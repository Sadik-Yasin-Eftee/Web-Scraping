Keeps logging me out of account saying session expired and everytime I try to log in it won't let me, keeps updating constantly even when I keep it up to date so not sure if the app is glitching, overall not a good app so may have to consider deleting Facebook as this has put me off and happens way too much, keep trying to update the app thinking it was that but its still not working and it says update again even after i already did

Facebook marketplace has a bug or a terrible feature where it will select a random picture as the main one (so the only one buyers see when searching and scrolling) keeps selecting a zoomed up tiny area of damage as the main photo instead of the actual overall photo of an object no wonder no one but scam bots message me now.
Events: [I search and scroll, It will select a random picture as the main one, It keeps selecting a zoomed up tiny area of damage as the main photo instead of the actual overall photo of an object]
