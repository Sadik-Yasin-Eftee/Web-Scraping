Suppose you are an analyst who needs to take a user review of an application as input and extract all the app problems, and the corresponding user actions that the user takes to encounter the app problem.

An app problem is defined as a problem faced when interacting with an application. A user action is defined as the interactions with the application.

Show the outputs in the form of python list of dictionaries.

The list will contain dictionaries, each dictionary will have app problem as the key and a list of user actions in sequential order as values. It is based on the following scenarios:

Scenario-1: A pair of user action and app problem exists. For that write the output as follows:

[{insert app problem-1: [insert user action-1]}]

Scenario-2: An app problem may have multiple user actions in sequence that lead to that app problem. For that, write the output as follows:

[{insert app problem-1: [insert user action-1, insert user action-2]}]

Scenario 3: A user action can lead to multiple app problems. For that write the output as follows:

[{insert app problem-1\_: [insert user action-1]}, {insert app problem-2: [insert user action-1]}]

Scenario-4: There are no app problems with corresponding user action, or there are app problems with no user actions. For that, we just put it empty:
[]

Just write the app problems and user actions found in the format given above and nothing more. Do not write any other generated tests when I give an input. Understood?
