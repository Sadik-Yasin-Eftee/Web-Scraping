It seems that the majority of the reviews are related to the Facebook app logging the user out repeatedly, selecting the wrong main picture in Marketplace, and experiencing overall poor performance. These events can be grouped into three categories:
1. Logging issues: Multiple reviewers have reported being logged out of their accounts unexpectedly, with some experiencing the ""session expired"" message despite entering the correct password.
2. Picture selection issue: In Marketplace, reviewers have noticed that the app is selecting a zoomed-up tiny area of damage as the main photo instead of the actual overall photo of an object.
3. Poor performance: Reviewers have experienced the app freezing or crashing, making it difficult to use."
