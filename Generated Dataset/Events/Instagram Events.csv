So many issues. I think every update just messes something else up. I use IG mostly for video chats and all of a sudden I can't connect to Bluetooth and I no longer have a full screen of the person I'm talking to nor do they get a full screen of me it's just two half photos on top of each other. Trash. The sound is not the best if you are in a room with anyone else since staying connected to Bluetooth is almost impossible. I would love to go back to normal video calls. Now instagram is down! 🤦,"Below is the contents and the events which are refined.

This app version has been compromised! I can't connect to this app to resolve my issues logging in. I lost my entire profile with pictures I will never be able to retrieve. It claims that I shared my password with 3rd party sites looking to receive likes. FALSE, and there is no way to contact anyone to dispute this error. Links lead to dead-end links that are not working. Terrible. It's a convenience that it happens on an election year. Call it what it is. Censorship.

Instagram is not saving my post captions or letting me edit my posts. All I can do is post images. That's it. Nothing has changed. It's barely usable. **update: that is finally fixed, but now I can't scroll (fast-forward) thru long videos that people post. Also, pinned posts no longer have a pin icon on them which is very confusing!

"I don't get why Instagram is so popular - you can't have horizontal and vertical aspect photos in the same post, you can't have more than 10 photos in a post, you can't have individual captions on your photos, and you can't edit posts or comments after posting, all things you can do on Facebook. People mostly just passively like photos on Instagram, vs any meaningful interaction or engagement.

Trying to post a picture from my camera roll to story, but the app doesn't see any photos in the camera roll. Only sees screen shots or downloads. I've signed out and in, deleted and reinstalled, reset all settings, etc.. It's been a month and IG has not done anything about it, or try to help. I'll have to use a different app for my content creation now. And of course there's no way to get a hold of them. They better fix this soon

Instagram has been the messiest app I've ever seen. I mean it makes it EXTREMELY hard to log in or sign up to any of your accounts. Plus it keeps telling you that something went wrong but they really don't even know what went wrong and leaves you frustrated like that and you they are not even trying to actually corporate and solve your problem. Like do not choose it as a means of communication or entrainment IT WILL GET MESSY. Edit: still trying to recover my accounts. One of the worst things.

Using a cat s22 flip phone, it is impossible to use this for anything other than simple scrolling or watching stories. Even then, the stories and videos are cropped too small to see all the text and the messages often won't show up as read even after you open them/ click on the videos. Clearly not much thought has gone into app design for this phone. Can't make posts, stories are annoying to use. Nothing works the way it would on any smart phone. Booooo Meta sucks

The app is amazing and all. BUT THE MODERATION SYSTEM IS WACK. I've commented stuff that doesn't even violate the terms and conditions but it still got removed and got my commenting rights taken away from me. Also, I had an Instagram account with a bit of weird name, I posted funny reels, But alot of people reported me and Instagram didn't even make sure if i violated anything, just straight up banned. Instagram should improve it's moderation system and let us appeal our punishments.

"Was looking for an update because all of a sudden it's gotten SO buggy. I can't create reels w/o it glitching & me having to either start over, or save the draft & ex out of the app. Even posting pictures is the same way.

Everything those below and within the last few weeks have said regarding issues a tablet. It was fine on a tablet as it was. At least provide the option for us choose where the navigation buttons are. Im sure it was more intended for those with foldable devices. Also it bugs out if you try to read comments on reels. If you head home then it just a blanked out space so you have to close and reopen the app.

"If I watch a lot of reels, eventually the app just freezes and I have to restart. Also, they keep updating the UI to be more minimalistic, which for an app focused on photography is oxymoronic. The notifications for comments doesn't get disabled, even when I go out of my way to not get notified of them from anybody. Oh, and my alt account that used to be linked to my main account is lost to me, unless I decide to find a way to bypass 2FA.

"the hashtag algorithm is horrible. you can only see top posts or ""recent"" top posts but they're not even recent. reels barely reach any audience most of the time if you're a small creator, and posts much less. now this new achievement feature: the 7 day story challenge resets whenever i get to the 7th day so i can never complete it also theres this 1 chat notification that wont dissappear, i did everything to get rid of it: checking messages, clearing cache, reinstalling instagram, etc.","Below is the contents and the events which are refined.

"I hate updating this app... because the updates BREAK the app. I hadn't updated since April 2021. It's been over a year and half. The app was working perfectly this entire time. The recent addition of longer story tabs was helpful to me so I updated it. Worse decision... Now my app is constantly having trouble loading content - either comments, profiles, or posts. It just keeps loading or it will say it couldn't load. I am ANNOYED. For context: I have an iPhone as well and it works fine there.","Below is the contents and the events which are refined.
