I have FB for marketplace only. When I take pictures of stuff to sell the pictures come out great. Then once I post them to marketplace the colors get distorted. This is super frustrating and it's making it almost impossible for me to sell anything. I've had other issues that were happening prior but those never affected the quality of my post. I'm not sure what is going on FACEBOOK but this needs to be resolved!,"Below is the contents and the events which are refined.

Every update adds a new problem. I get logged out multiple times a day. When I tap on a post it takes like 30 seconds to load 2 or 3 comments. If I want to see the rest I have to tap ""all comments"" and that takes 30 more seconds to load. When scrolling through my news feed I see nothing but posts made by random pages I don't follow or care about. I have to scroll for like 5 minutes if I want to see a friend's post, and the post is usually a week old. Tired of every update making the app worse!

The auto refresh bug has rendered this app useless. Wether it's clicking an ad, typing a comment or browsing the marketplace, you can be sure the page will refresh and you'll lose the item/ad/comment/page that you were looking at. This makes interacting with FB impossible. This is what happens when you try to fix something that wasn't broken.

System 'back' button not working on Android devices. Seems it's been a known issue for a while. This means you scroll down your newsfeed, click on comments to read or post a comment and you're stuck there. You can't go 'back', leaving you with no option but to close the app and restart it. Problem started spontaneously using the last version of the app, which prompted me to update to the latest version to discover there is no change. Perhaps not the app, but something at the 'Facebook end'

Make it optional on Facebook marketplace to go private with multiple listings. For example users can click on my profile and see what I sell. Anyone can search up let's say a diamond ring for sell, but knowing I wouldn't want them meeting at my house they'd just select my profile page and find another item I may have, say for example a weight set that is too heavy to bring outside so I give them my house address for thieves to then easily break into. It poses a severe safety risk for its users.

Good app but too big of a file they know that not every phone can handle a 100mb+ app that's the same as a decent game. Most free phones are only 32gb and even at 120gb I don't like seeing such a basic app needing so much space. This app was the same size as the lite years ago around 20mb and the lite was miniscule. Adding reels and stuff doesn't create that much data. What else are you trying to put on our phones? Just because nicer phones have better memory doesn't mean you can jack sizes up,"Below is the contents and the events which are refined.

Facebook is not the same anymore. Use to love keeping in touch with family and close friends. I have more problems being on here than actually using it for its intended service. Dealing with more than one profile, profile getting hack, or someone posing as you, catfish, or problem with their two factor identification to recover your account. They only have articles to help try to get stuff fixed. No human help. I find myself using this app day by day.
