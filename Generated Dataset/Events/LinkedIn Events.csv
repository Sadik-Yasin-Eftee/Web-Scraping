LinkedIn Premium is a scam. The app will do everything to make you subscribe, sending you messages, emails, and showing ads. Once you're subscribed, it's like a black hole they will make it very difficult for you to cancel, you'll have to go through multiple steps. No invoice sent to your email either so you're unaware of the monthly renewal. Be aware if you're looking to get the Premium.

Poor. Quite unintuitive to navigate. Also, everything seems to be in Chinese, including the App Name on my phone. Not entirely sure why. Maybe it's because I work for a Chinese company, or because I'm using a Huawei phone from China (just pre-ban P30, so has all the services), but I can't actually read Chinese (I can speak to a quite basic level). Any chance you could like maybe make it English?

Made an account when looking for a job. Got bombarded with endless emails I couldn't care less about, about random people not even in my space, which I couldn't stop as my settings just reset after stopping email notifications, making me miss new connections in the sea of irrelevant emails. Got no push notifications and not even just an indication that I have new invitations. I talked to no one that I hadn't started talking with outside of LinkedIn and the platform felt mostly pointless.

"Well, the app is useful but it has one major drawback. In order to get around government restrictions imposed on LinkedIn, I have to use VPN. Upon scrolling the Home feed, LinkedIn app starts automatically playing video posts. I have to quickly stop each video as I scroll, so the app doesn't consume my limited VPN traffic. And this is really annoying! Why can't i simply disable auto-play in the app?","Below is the contents and the events which are refined.
