0bb5c5bc-4449-4173-93b7-0becb2c4d52f,Incredibly aggressive. There is no way to skip the first few questions (job title/studies). Why do I have to do it from the get-go when I can add it later how I want? This app - and just the website really - has gotten worse and worse with each update. Navigating and just using LinkedIn gets harder and more annoying. So many useless features that employers can't use correctly anyway. What is with this recent trend of willful overcomplication of working systems? Facebook 1.2.
ef3cb9be-dc87-436e-844e-75e4a47b527b,App is nice until you need to upload a CV bigger than 2mb through easy apply. Could you just go back to the time were CVs upload size capped at 5 mb. Kindly fix this ASAP
4f08afcf-4dfd-46fd-be29-57b5e20e5693,"Foul app. After completing Captcha, they always display no user captcha response. I can't log in with my PC or Phone. I am frustrated with this. Please fix it ASAP."
94306004-4b1e-4384-9f24-3ddc43eefe9a,"would give 0 stars if I could. terrible app, it bugs you with useless notifications at all times even if you deactivate the ones you do not care about, a lot of the applications never go through, ""easy apply"" almost never works. it bugs you constantly about getting premium. customer support is non-existent, too. you MIGHT get a reply after many days, sometimes, but they will just say they closed the case and offer no help at all."
2b1cefe6-41e4-4d43-96d0-784a533ad4fc,"I am very much frustrated from LinkedIn because my ID has been restricted and I am not able to recover it. When I made a new ID LinkedIn restricted it too. Very poor customer support, takes too much time to respond 😕.."
58a4f51f-c16a-4501-9ebe-4b85323f1f89,"When people can't get the likes they want on Facebook, they use linkedin. The job listing aren't real and the fake motivational stuff the peddle is annoying."
9174faf7-2e75-4090-b3bd-226d5a6b58f5,"Can't log in for some reason. Over the last few years, I've tried to login, then I just delete the app. Every time it says wrong user name or wrong password. So today I changed my password. Wrote it down & also asked Google to remember it. Tried to login and it wouldn't let me. I even manually typed in my password. It still wouldn't let me. So once again I deleted this stupid app off my phone. I think I'm better off."
4a24984b-ea8f-4257-ad79-d2c0991c02cb,"When I click on a post to comment or read it fully, the post disappears and the feed seems to refresh. So now I cannot find the post unless I caught the poster's name , go to their feed and comb through their activities. It's not a pleasant experience interacting with LinkedIn via this app."
e603a726-1cfe-4c17-9836-094ca48bb2d0,"Wosrt experience, i can't even add email id in my profile and without that i can't contact linkedin customer service for ky other issues. . While clicking on add email id, it just says something went wrong. It is not at all enabling the option to type my email id. It is so irritating. I want to enhance my Id and after coming this far, i can't even think of making new Id. Please just fix it."
90cabffc-0491-48b2-bfcf-d8ce703b07f4,All that time I spent building a profile to not be able to update my email address even with the password. Said had to be from my original email account that I deactivated due to safety and security issues. Since when has an email address become a form of identification? I can close my account with the password but I can't update the information? Lost my business for that. Done letting Google and Apple have more control over my identity then I do. You should too.
0b89c958-81a4-4ed7-a0cd-e11d4a30ba61,Why had happened to this app after the update? I am not able to access the account. What have you done to your application? This is now a big useless app if you can't even login. 😤
0bb03eb8-7b61-4766-88cd-2169ea299eb4,I am not able to login to my account after entering correct answer also it is asking me to solve puzzle again and again. LinkedIn please solve this issue it's really very irritating.
b634fdaa-280f-47d1-b744-b014dce9e449,"The password code you sent must be automatically filled while one is trying to open the app in case of ""forget password"". While one looks for the code in email and then try to enter it, the previous page of your app disappears. And thus one is unable to open the app. Can you pay attention to it? The Problem still persist. I have tried it several times even after reinstalling the app. Deleting the app for ever."
3b2fdc3c-9753-4b45-a46a-92d306019e25,I've been trying so many times to purchase my subscription. It didn't work. It kept saying that LinkedIn is experiencing some problem. What problem? If you can't provide the Premium option anymore than you should consider of removing the tool from your platform. Don't give someone hope while we can't even use it (Premium). I'm very disappointed in you! I've been using LinkedIn for years and I never felt so bad like this!
4c1476fc-be87-4db7-a067-e45b5f3518c8,Just created an ID yesterday and this app has restricted my access to it today. Even after uploading govt issued identity it is not letting me log into my own account.
148386da-58a5-4aaa-97d4-6bec58624519,"Very disappointed. I tried one month free trial, later I realized that it wasn't useful for me. I tried to cancel my subscription then. I didn't have funds on the card attached for few weeks after that. Once I got my salary on that card, subscription fee was directly charged from my card. I can't contact LinkedIn for a refund, as there is literally no customer support! I canceled my subscription the same day again!"
d652940f-aadc-4db5-b3d4-fa4588a4b227,"Recently there has been too many error which has been described below by other fellow users: no internet, unknown error, unable to load and the works.... Tried the usual uninstall and reinstall, no difference. Perhaps you should consider rolling back to a previous version until all these are fixed. It has become counter productive to use the app. The problem is getting worse and now I cannot login on mobile. If you read the long list of comments, we have the same problem."
05b6d850-7f81-4bc7-b33e-2882918436c5,"App worked well until last month or so and now fails to load anything and often notifications aren't received. If i do get them, then clicking it fails to load anything. Haven't seen an update for a while so wondering if LinkedIn devs even know of a problem and what sort of tests are in place to avoid releases with major issues! Please sort out, especially as i pay for a premium account and not getting any sort of service."
afbdcd91-cb19-429b-85bb-598728d51f59,"I am disappointed with the newest version of LinkedIn. When I tried to surf like usual on LinkedIn, it didn't show anything then I tried to uninstall the app and reinstall it, yet it didn't want to log in, the sign in button didn't work and stuck there. What's wrong with the newest version? Seriously, it's not an upgrade more like a downgrade."
f83790df-a544-4756-8e49-31371dab6448,The mobile testing of the app has not been done properly..there is bug in the application as it doesn't allow user to upload any file extension except jpeg or png file. The media field allows two options either camera or from gallery . This doesn't allow user to upload resume as pdf or docx. But when we switch to desktop version it allows every extension to upload. Kindly fix the bug.
43fe4cbf-4759-40b5-9796-0c38036f58a6,"Probably the worst update I ever seen. Today when I was writing a post, I received a notice just in the middle of my screen. ( that basically blocked everyting until I was forced to update my linkedin ) The results of your update are on the level of a Commodore 64 without Simon's Basic extension !! So I installed your ""update"" Linkedin icone is gone and I need to go via Google to find you. Before your ""update"", normally when you want to modify a post you have the possibilities to EDIT COMMENTS or DELETE COMMENT Now only the DELETE COMMENT is available. Pityfull !"
d234d860-63e1-48d6-98b5-5c2491f0f03a,"Linkedin had decided that i was violating their policy (which i wasn't), asked me to verify my account by submitting an ID, which i did. I had access to my account after for few days but then got blocked again. No one notified me that it was restricted. I had to find that out on my own. Emailed support but they were, and still are unresponsive. They would give no explanation or reason as to why they restricted my access. Generally very bad experience, not a trustworthy app."
f62d20f0-78d7-42cf-b330-6b6dd3754ffe,"For a very long time now I have not been able to post on LinkedIn, after writing my content and click post it will just continue loading there without posting"
b0f73ac5-3456-4f62-977c-ae398a4fc069,"This has got to be the worse all I've used in my life. I put in all my details, press next to go to the next page just for it to say, something went wrong. Then it gives you the option to dismiss. All the information is correct. Waste of my time, app deleted! LinkedIn replied to this email, I tried to reply via the link they send to show them what is not working. The email like does not load."
388089f6-7873-4d88-9909-bde464ce760c,"Everytime I tried to change info on the account settings and privacy settings...it leads me to ""SIGN IN""...and when I logged in...verification code was sent from a LOCAL NUMBER...Yet even if I comply..it won't lead me to the settings where I'm supposed to change. I've done an upgrade thinking that It might be due to its version...but same scenario occured. I've deleted cached data...run my anti virus..but with no avail.. Could you please fix this issue? Please..I'm running out of patience.TY!"
0a06a041-7c33-4156-9ad7-df7a7be0ffed,After every process error massage is coming out. Either you are updating profile to trying to contact them.every time error massage are generated.also unable to get excess to my account when trying to open after a long time. Verification system is so much poor.i send the documents multiple times but all are rejected. And also too many bugs to fix with
3295fadf-0a0d-4d26-9e2f-299b9a5e087d,Shows part of puzzle when security check comes up on phone!
32506788-8015-4e4f-844d-e256bb0c0875,"The latest update for the app as well as web app is completely buggy. The login feature has completely crashed since last 2weeks & none bothered to fix it. OTP for 2-step authentication is not coming at all, even the Call for OTP ain't working. Today, experienced sign in issue. Initially I thought that I was giving wrong password but then checked it & noticed there's no error message, so password entered was correct but sign in has also crashed. How can anyone use the app without sign in?"
f801acf4-ea1d-4814-af0c-75d78befa494,"no support from linked in. They closed my account, and even after I provided all the documents they asked to prove I am real owner of the account they still are not replying."
019d4aa6-5a7e-4d59-919e-eb6504880772,"It's very buggy. It doesn't allow to apply to some jobs (including Easy Apply ones). Sometimes, it shows ""Something went wrong"" on the click of the Submit button. And now it's telling me to Add and Confirm an email address while I could see I have 2 email addresses already added and verified. Customer support keeps saying it has been resolved, but it hasn't."
401be346-40be-499b-85d4-9949bd6cb89c,Terrible. I never got signed in after downloading the app. Kept getting stuck on the captcha. Over and over and over and over. I didn't try and uninstall reinstall because honestly that's a waste of my dang time. I would just open a browser and go through that away. Tha ks for the spaghetti coded junk app.
c85b50fe-d4ac-49c6-b289-1927d8b901b0,"Updated twice, turned off automatically after these 2 updates recieved in Oct-2023"
b9a51c3a-049c-426f-9289-c127b708eca3,"Since a couple of weeks, the app suddenly stops working and won't connect, showing an empty feed and a retry button that does nothing. The support team has been rather useless, radio silence after asking the million dollar question ""have you updated the app to its latest version?"". Nobody asking for logs therefore not sure how they can troubleshoot the problem. Tried reinstalling, it works for a few days until it stops again. Underwhelming."
122b4e97-0970-427b-8577-4c3870833dd2,"I am trying to retrieve my lost password by using my phone. You get sent a pin but then you have to leave the app page to get it from your email then go back and when you go back to Linked in, the page to put the pin in disappears and you're just asked to put in your sign in details and start again! It would require a separate device so that you don't have to leave the page. It's so frustrating that I've given up. Don't have time for that!"
716e9239-2629-4fd0-8e91-481667a104a9,After the latest update around 2 days ago my account was logged out automatically and when i am trying to login its saying that my account is restricted i've been using LinkedIn for a long time and this is the first time something like this happened after an update. I a trying to gain access of my account as per the instruction but there has been no success. It would be great someone resolve my issue cause it took great effort to build a valuable profile.
7452b17e-8677-4391-8a9c-1069781fbeed,"One of the worst Application, I came accross in terms of Job search. I was trying to search about ""Robotics Trainer / Robotics Engineer"" as job title. Job location: Remote. When i set this as my preference, LinkedIn has showed me more than 1k results where it never matched my search at all. I felt very ridiculous as you allow me to choose and not give the proper response for the same. It also sets the location automatically though we change in later part."
afe6e3c3-2460-4eba-815d-bbd2273bb208,I wanted to log in the application it just keep asking to get verified as human even after I successfully did that couple of times already. It keep making me to put the password and try to log in but not letting me to be logged in. It's not something like I've forgotten my password or something it's clearly a bug of the software. Super to say but it really made my super disappointed.☹️
040cc566-cfc8-4bb0-a126-c41fe135bff1,This app is getting old. I can never make a post when I'm on my phone. I always have to find a computer to even respond to or make a comment. Can someone fix this?
68e7a4bc-b909-43cf-9408-d4feeff6d444,"Absolutely the WORST app to search for jobs if you're a fresher just out of college or are in the final year of graduation, even after setting the job alert for jobs that hire fresher ls, the job filters are so bad that it CONSTANTLY recommends jobs that are hiring for senior role 😒"
783881fe-6423-4c8a-bfeb-c843eebc65cd,"Useless, wasting my time, i am not able to access my account, linked asking me identity ID for security check after submitting Identity Id my account still not accessable from last 4 days."
c8b60080-ac33-4b5b-8054-34c6f443bfa4,"Usually quite happy with the app. But since approx. a year, changes in published posts, e.g. tagging members/companies, aren't saved. Updating & reinstalling the app hasn't helped. Advise by support is equally useless. As a heavy user, managing 8 pages, this is really frustrating and has kept me from upgrading. Surprisingly, I have not experienced the same issue when accessing LI via browser or the iOS app. Not purchasing a new device just because you refuse to resolve a bug you have caused."
d57e720a-2ed5-4e5d-9456-e0de656c58ef,Its a complete worst app.if you want to block on doing connects then why you allow to do connect. I got my three accounts blocked and fourth account is in security check and want identity proof i uploaded everything still they didn't work on my request. Its a complete rubbish.
04292f28-07ba-416e-8467-8570d0bb1bf4,"The 'Industry' field keeps saying ""industry is a required field"" even after filling it and thus I'm unable to save the edited information."
d001b922-8b85-493b-940c-9e8e60f5ca74,"App keeps breaking. It's the 6th time I have to unninstall and re-install the app as a few days later it breaks , does not show anything in any page and after I clear cache and data, it won't even log back in! I've been using the app for years and had never had any issues, but it's unbearable right now, so I'm writing this review and will contact the dev team."
547daf94-f5c1-431d-808b-e6b6ef232e01,"UX is so annoying while using the filters for searches. Can't it select all the options at one single search instead of making me type for each option I need to select. (For example, if I need to select multiple locations in the filter, I'll have to do it one by one waiting for the app to take one input at a time and then typing the same thing again for it to take the second input and so on)"
28d6ebe0-579a-44f7-9950-49e4c167d6c2,"before you ask what phone, version and Android version let me give it to you.HTC U 11, Android 8.0.0, and the latest linked in version. can't load feed, every page on the app is blank. seems this problem started ever since the linked in jobs app was discontinued and linked in was updated. when you ask your users for their phone model and version it means you want your users to do testing for you. very disappointed. I'm currently working on linked in using internet explorer. I don't get messages."
48cedfff-0f51-4f02-9596-e7271b1fb74b,"Behaves like a virus/malware. Never intentionally installed it, it seems to have put itself on my auto update list. If you click to uninstall, it says you have to update. If you update, it let's you click uninstall, but then loops to update again. This should not be tolerated on, or by, Google. Cancelled my LinkedIn account years ago when I found out how insecure it is. Despise intrusive software like this. Anyone know how to get rid?"
354a0488-c2eb-432f-ba82-627431f96956,Worst.! I raised multiple requests after my account was hacked unable to get any help from LinkedIn team on this.!
10a2f0bb-be3f-4d3c-963b-d57f119424dc,Not able to login even after giving correct credentials. It was returning to same sign in page even after signing in.
9e4abcc4-814c-4483-81bc-44af73adf068,The app as of late has not allowed me to upload my first post. I receive an error message after it loads for a few moments.
237c3623-272e-42b5-a3d3-2b3292301dc7,"Horrible - Billing Style You guys are too BIG for this!! When I activated a TRIAL, you mentioned I will be billed from one month after expiration. My simple question is, WHY ARE YOU BILLING me before TIME.... Please I need an explanation and a REFUND asap. Moreso, the DEACTIVATION button is hidden and complex and is not easily accessible like the ACTIVATION button. I don't even know how to deactivate because your steps you outlined is incorrect."
3bd31625-6cf1-4c6b-b404-64e1a1ec59d2,"It was great, until it become like Facebook We prefer using it because of its minimalistic and simple but professional approach to its users. Now, it's becoming trash. My day? Who cares, about what they eat at breakfast? What they wear at work? #OOTD? WHAT THE??!!!! App latest update crashes when you click job. Do something about it. Lots of bugs!"
a6ff54d3-a143-48eb-ae2a-f43bb0e15255,"The app is very buggy with tons of small bugs that worsen the user experience. And the biggest one that I have started facing recently is that even with internet access, app says ""No internet, try again"" and doesn't load a thing. I have to reinstall the app from play store and login again. Then again after 1-2 days, same thing repeats. Other small bugs include my profile picture showing blank, others' profile picture doesn't load every time etc. Even the website is full of bugs. I'm fed up now."
86b2d16a-95b7-41d1-b91d-66582464a7eb,Awful. Constant notifications and emails even after blocking and unsubscribing and uninstalling the app. No matter what I do I can't get this thing to leave me alone. I've been reporting it as spam and unsubscribing every time I get an email or notification. I will never use this app
93ce958b-614f-4efd-a633-59a6854bef22,"What a painful experience your app always gives me! Whenever you write after spending a time, effort and when it's the turn to post, it crashes away and boom, your 500 words are wasted now. It also crashes whenever we click add photo button or post button. When it can't operate on a 4 gb, 64 gb phone then should should we buy a rocket to run linkedin app? It's 2021 and linkedin is draining our efforts."

I hope you guys pay attention about this and fix it as soon as possible."
349870c2-518e-4f5d-b50e-7c4451f24a43,"Worst app. I have been using this app for years and as we humans are becoming more advanced with the advancement of time. LinkedIn is going back to dark ages it seems. I have stopped using this app since last year. It doesn't work iny phone (OnePlus 6 - android 10, oxygen os 10.3) .

Pictures auto slide automatically, and there is no way to stop it. This is especially bad when you are reading a long text from a picture. Very bad UX."
87e348d3-a998-437e-806d-31ab278e37ab,Can you please fix the way too hidden option of sending a message upon connecting to someone.

d473f0b2-2f31-446f-ad5d-584ec3196913,Very bad experience. The Linkedin platform though I was a genuine user without anything wrong from my side restricted two accounts back to back. I have lost many connections. I can't even login to close my account. Always it shows incorrect password while logging in. And when I login it shows to submit my id. After submitting the id it shows a representative will contact from LinkedIn. No such contact was taken place. Nobody have called or contacted. Very bad experience all together.

Soon as you log in it asks you to download the app because it works better. Every page I navigate it asks. Why tout the app when you were initially created from a web page and thus gained loyal users due to that particular interface? Highly upset every time I navigate the web page I am bombarded with attempts to convert me to the app and always asking me while not providing an opt out for asking me!

It is just like facebook. It is not helping me at all and also constantly asking for premium version. After using this app my suggestion is that if your a fresher don't go with it app instead search jobs and internships directly on company's web sites that will be lot more easier and convenient.

I recently joined a prestigious institution and that has prompted a lot of connection requests and profile views. They restricted my account for ""unusual activity"" 3 times in 1 week. When I contacted support instead of fixing this they said if it happens again they'll suspend my account permanently.How am I supposed to connect to people if they keep restricting I'm unable to accept more than 10requests a day cause of this."

If a job requires a specific language, enabling to filter it out should be possible. On top of this, the companies that post jobs require 5 or more years of experience when you search for junior/associate level jobs. Search by field of work also is very inaccurate; you search for marketing and you get HR, sales, etc. Also disable your contact profile visit notifications."

I tried security check with visual and play sound. It is passing and when i again trying to login it is taking me again on this security check page. I have tried more than 4-5 times. What is benefit of this app if user can not reactivate the account. Frustrated and ridiculous
