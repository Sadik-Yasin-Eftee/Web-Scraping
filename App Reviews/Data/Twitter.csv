Downloaded the App for the first time and was immediately informed that my account was locked/suspended. Went through all the verification steps and still the account is locked. A message to X Support went unanswered and there does not appear to be a way to contact them. Still to this day, I've never used this platform so I have no idea what the platform is about, and no way to start using it. Wish I could rate it Zero stars...",1

I have to keep a tab with X open in Google Chrome just to post photos! Also, the search bar in the search section has been hit or miss recently with results not always showing.

It's not an Internet problem, it's an app problem. This same issue never happens on the browser, which I have to switch to whenever the app stops working. This is absurd and the worst thing about it is that people at X either don't know about this issue or just don't care...",1

And it doesn't offer up much to allow u to just click back to what u were viewing. U have to navigate back to the account and then to the post. Many other apps stay on the previous screen when I return, but on X it's frustrating so it limits my use of the site.

Why would anyone need to scroll twice for tweets. There are way too many ads. Honestly, it's getting worse and worse by every update. It's not worth a download anymore.
