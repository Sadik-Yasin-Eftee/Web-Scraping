91ab3354-187b-4153-9c0a-cd6c4646de9b,"I've been having a persistent issue involving reels - specifically, reels that are sent to me via Messenger. After clicking on a sent reel and being redirected to the Facebook app, I am met with a gray screen and text on the bottom reading ""Comments are disabled."" In other words, the reels don't even load for me. This is frustrating because I am able to view reels while on the app and send them to friends, but I only have problems when one is sent to me and I cannot view it due to the error.",1
6de82309-cf29-414f-a3e4-64dd5d5dac7c,I have FB for marketplace only. When I take pictures of stuff to sell the pictures come out great. Then once I post them to marketplace the colors get distorted. This is super frustrating and it's making it almost impossible for me to sell anything. I've had other issues that were happening prior but those never affected the quality of my post. I'm not sure what is going on FACEBOOK but this needs to be resolved!,1

Despite numerous attempts to sign in, I am consistently met with an ""unexpected error"" or ""session timed out"" message. This prevents me from regaining access to my account.

There is no virus on my phone or issues with any other apps. This happens multiple times a day Update 3/5/2024 My account keeps logging me out and I don't remember the passwords.

I have un and reinstalled it several times and it'll load up for a few seconds but before I can do anything substantial, it brings up a ""something went wrong"" screen with a retry button that loads for a second but does nothing. I cannot use the app at all and I don't believe their support team has emailed me back. My account is still fine when I go through a desktop browser.",1

Even does it on the browser version too. With how popular Facebook is, this should not be happening even after re-instalatiin of the app and everything. Guess I have no choice but to quit this app for good since I can't even reset anything or attempt to get into my account. Shouldn't be happening with a good development team.",1

It has evolved into the user being overwhelmed with ads and content that has nothing to do with the user and worse, there is no way to block, or remove that content. Think of it as watching a 30 minute TV show with 25 minutes of ads. Facebook developer's have totally runied the original concept of a ""social platform"". Shame on them!",1

So I try the forgot password and get a link sent to me via email and enter it the app does nothing . What's up with this 💩 . Now i can't login to either of my accounts. The FB screens have been Jerky as well for some reason. FB yall are having some serious issues. FIX IT !!!!,1

Also, the account options are confusing and constantly changing, so good luck ever finding anything. The follow option seems to be quite broken too. I don't always get notifications for people that I have chosen to follow, but I get plenty of notifications for people that I liked one post by. It's just a mess of an app in terms of functionality.",1

Sometimes if you pause a video, it will restart at the beginning when you press play. Some videos will just pause randomly and either resume playing after skipping ahead, or just refuse to play past a certain point. Some videos will make you watch 1 or 2 ads in the middle, even if the video is only 30 seconds long. You can't even see comments without being redirected to Instagram.",1

Also, my like icons are gone, and sometimes even the option to do a like is gone. Videos are also a terrible experience. They work like reels, which is horrible for longer videos, and having the video play over and over again while reading the comments just kills it for me. Is interesting seeing this many issues from such a big company.",1

Edit: Cool, so instead of fixing the existing back button issue, you actually just made it work even less than it did before. Thanks a lot. When I press the back button, I want to EXIT THE APP. I don't want you to scroll to the top and load more garbage to waste my time on. I used to just shrug it off, but recently, spamming the back button no longer (eventually) closes it; it just stays open.",1

The app will also not upload photos from your saved albums, just gallery, camera roll and screenshots. It also crashed/froze three times while swiping. If you swipe, button inputs will stop working. On top of that, 90% of the people I see are over 100 miles away and I live in a major city! All in all, it's a broken, under baked feature that feels like an afterthought instead of a standalone dating app.",1
ed929e0b-36a2-4890-bb4a-e47438038cfc,Got caught in a session expired loop with an up to date app and phone software. Literally no reason to continue to refuse me access to my account I've had for more than a decade. As soon as I log in I get a session expired message. It's done this 6 times this morning. I even Uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Didn't help. I wouldn't be so bent out of shape if some of the last messages from my dead father weren't on that account. Do better.,1

Also hijacks my phone when it crashes, not allowing me to access any screens or other apps, forcing me to restart my phone. And the newest thing now is I can't access marketplace, and I've got no explanation as to why. Overall, the quality of Facebook has been on a steady decline. Deleting profile and app.",1

There are buttons that appear on top of the video that cannot be hidden, and it repeats the same video instead of serving up another video on the same show. Why can't you fix this so that the reel player is only used for the short dumb TikTok like clips and leave the longer videos alone?! I'm sick of this happening!",1

The ""help"" pages show things I don't have on my page, like the 3 little bars in the corner. When I go to the edit section, nothing happens. Another waste of time. All I wanted to do was something simple, yet FB manages to complicate it. Somehow I'm not surprised as they've never replied in the past to help with an actual SOLUTION!!

After receiving & entering my confirmation code, I'm given a blank screen where the only other option is to go back and redo the process. Each time resulting in the same blank screen.

4ae9d8b4-76e4-4a09-bed6-b4ee0fccc007,Every time I get a new phone I always have a difficult time getting Facebook again. They always say that my password is not right when I've just set it up & I always have to start a new account which means I have to start all over with my friends & they don't want to accept because they think I've been hacked. So I have fewer friends & I just don't know if it's worth it anymore. A lot of my friends have quit Facebook anyway. But I want Messenger so I guess I have to put up with it.,2
