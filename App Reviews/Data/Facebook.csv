It signs me out multiple times a day randomly. I've tried checking for updates, signing out and back in, changing passwords, uninstalling and reinstalling, the list goes on. So frustrating!",2

Not able to do it through messenger app with the same results. I log on with my cell phone and Mac and having been doing so since I've had the app. This is a security issue. Fix This!!! In this day and age one should be able to delete a phone number associated with their account immediately, no questions. Only work around for this is you have to deactivate your account.",2

If I try to reopen it, it goes immediately to wherever I was -- so it obviously didn't close. So why does it disappear every time? This has been an intermittent issue that changes with various updates -- after some updates, it doesn't close the window anymore. And then other updates, it does that again. PLEASE FIX THIS!",2
9284336c-9643-47af-84e9-28443458c8ea,"Ok app, if you can deal with constant reshuffling of the interface. Unfortunately, it can and will spam you with notifications. Even if you turn it off everywhere (countless locations), every few updates it still ""grows"" new ways to boggle you with unrelated content, like the Hydra. The ""new"" features tend to show up leading to the quarterly earning report. I know you're trying to keep up the engagement and numbers, but please try to do it in a more subtle way",2

It does the same when trying to see who has liked a pictures. It also glitches so bad. I can't even scroll through anything because it freezes and lags continuously. I've tried to restart my phone, reinstall the app...nothing helps.",2

This last update has caused a problem with uploading multiple pictures in one post. Didn't have any issues until it updated. And I tried uninstalling it, but it forces you to update before you can get back into it. The pictures go to my story but doesn't actually post to my time line.",2

I see more stuff from pages I don't even follow, than those I do and even my FB friends. Show me the stuff from my friends and pages I actually FOLLOW! I am not even getting all notifications. WHAT THE HECK???",2
3b453744-b508-42c4-a0a1-06a93adb3def,"As a senior, the apps are nothing but an annoyance. They don't adjust text to suite my need for lagrer print, and rotated my same size fonts 🙄, just more of them. I also see no need to doawload, either of them, when I can have a better experience from my browser. So when they decide to shut the browsers out I'll go elsewhere, and not hassle with it.",2
26885a14-175b-4ddd-8005-e65376abdf12,"Glitching out horribly. I can't access messenger through the app, then when trying to access through Facebook, get stuck in messenger and can't get back to my newsfeed. I have had to uninstall & reinstall Facebook a few times to get unstuck. Super frustrating as I run a few groups and get lots of DM's. Of course Facebook itself is just a nightmare of algorithms, control, suppression, commercialization and horrible overall as well. Definitely not the wonderful space it was.",2
271c2554-653a-44da-b681-0a1744a0728a,"WILDLY rife with glitches lately, more than I've seen in years. I never get all of my direct notifications. I've made sure all my settings are appropriately engaged, still not getting fully a third (maybe more) of my notifications. Feed refreshes arbitrarily so I lose my place. App has started not showing comments I've made on posts, even with ""All Comments"" enabled. Memories are completely borked (can't see them in their entirety, like it's 2011 again; also cannot open the photos). And so on.",2

Until I specifically close it by itself. I have the same phone and have never had this issue before. Started around the New Year. Ive looked through the permissions of my app and can't figure out how to fix it. Facebook is becoming more of a head ache than anything else honestly.",2

These problems have been going on for a few years now and I've seen troubleshoots and reports and it.. never stops. so yeah getting frustrating",2
d9ff681f-841b-4fd0-bbc4-d36184034d27,"the timeline often refreshed while reading posts. there are more advertised posts and advertisements than personal stories. there have been times when the frequency of the timeline refreshing has prevented the user(me) from making it past two one line posts, which would then disappear. Once a valuable tool for interpersonal communication it is now more for dissociation and disinformation. I miss my friends, especially the ones I don't see often.",2

9032d3ef-7c2f-4e87-87ac-8df67fd4d4cb,"Did someone buy Facebook, or is Mark bored and wanting to mess with people!? The constant changes are horrible. If they actually made changes that were improvements to the platform, I would be happy with them, but so far, they are not helpful. Also, the increased amount of ads and sponsored sites cluttering your feed is absolutely ridiculous! No matter what features you turn off in settings for every post you see from a friend, you see three or more of these ads or sponsors!",2
2d9ee65b-d7f9-4f06-a665-673d0e9a5457,"Facebook changed in so many ways and it not for the better it gets dumber every day. For sample, the news feed u see something and you want to view the comments and it shows most relevant by default and your having to keep clicking show all, this is so dumb. the app keeps crashing, overloading your phone forcing it to shut down and protect it self from Facebook. don't get me started on the scams and the video that are not appropriate.",2

Otherwise, I use the full desktop user agent on Vivaldi Browser to access the Web version with a DARK background, with all information on the page, just like on a PC. Looks GREAT on this tablet phone when open. No need for a separate Messenger application either, because it's integrated into the web page. BTW, FB App IS a big data hog.",2

08440358-83e2-4ba6-a473-dbdcd40606d7,"Ridiculous update -- the Back button no longer works. You have to use the one within Facebook. I have no idea what possible good this does unless it improves tracking. Also, for several months now, they changed a setting. It used to be you could open all links in an external browser. Now it doesn't work for that -- it says it only does that for links set in Messages. Annoying and ridiculous.",2

This means manuslly tapping extra commands to go to my paid app subscriptions directly. To make things worse, the News tab only shows about a dozen or so articles each day that I can't refresh to see additional articles, which defeats the purpose of a news aggregation service. Otherwise, the app is usable when it's not showing you an ad every other post.",2
ff78c918-63d6-47ea-a25e-f68bcb8bde1e,"This is easily one of the worst apps to manage. Settings are a dumpster fire of confusion. Which I'm guessing is made that way on purpose to keep things working exactly the same. The default news feed is ridiculous. Even simple things like dark mode settings are impossible to find on certain devices. The design is boring, cluttered, and often confusing. I am so sick of that shade of blue. Are they still worried about brand recognition?",2

I just wind up closing the app. again.",2
3974110d-4b03-46b4-8438-f6c63e181c94,"So as reviews say, the back button broke. Chalk that to minor inconvenience, but it's part of a bigger problem. The interface broke compared to a year ago. Across time, more features left, but pretend they're there. You can't share to w business page anymore unless logged in as the page. It gives you the option but has given an error for a while. That means losing the place you were at, because you can't put the link URL INTO FB to get to it. They should allow you to comment AS your profile.",2
f7d0ce77-618b-456d-8303-5c0de66e8a9e,"Same complaint. Back button no longer available. Additionally, I can no longer access / download files.
