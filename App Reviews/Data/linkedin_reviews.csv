725ba2e5-a049-4e73-9982-40b5c4bdc409,You rolled out a verification feature but yet I can upload more than 5mb? That is a flaw considering many people use their phone and default size is larger than 5 mb. Increase image size.
0bb5c5bc-4449-4173-93b7-0becb2c4d52f,Incredibly aggressive. There is no way to skip the first few questions (job title/studies). Why do I have to do it from the get-go when I can add it later how I want? This app - and just the website really - has gotten worse and worse with each update. Navigating and just using LinkedIn gets harder and more annoying. So many useless features that employers can't use correctly anyway. What is with this recent trend of willful overcomplication of working systems? Facebook 1.2.
ef3cb9be-dc87-436e-844e-75e4a47b527b,App is nice until you need to upload a CV bigger than 2mb through easy apply. Could you just go back to the time were CVs upload size capped at 5 mb. Kindly fix this ASAP
c94df629-52f3-42fa-bc44-c16b01f69269,"Something has broken in the app. It keeps prompting me to update, but I have updates turned on automatically and there is no update to install. The messaging function does not work. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times. I guess I'll just stop using it on my phone, and therefore using less frequently."
936dab33-23cf-4ce9-90cb-600300043c1f,The App is full of annoying bugs like it is showing 2 new notifications but there are none in the inbox. Above that it is ignoring my notifications settings to not send me Emails like job alerts and stuff. I contacted the support but just received an invitation to an online Pro Seminar to understand more payment features instead of technical help. => Not interested in LinkedIn anymore!
4f08afcf-4dfd-46fd-be29-57b5e20e5693,"Foul app. After completing Captcha, they always display no user captcha response. I can't log in with my PC or Phone. I am frustrated with this. Please fix it ASAP."
c343c4ce-5cc6-45f0-99a5-75a01d28623e,Hate the app just trying to apply for a job and have to scroll through loads of unnecessary rubbish
816f713b-0313-4f99-a6ee-4cc3a9703c0f,"Can't upload picture or video on my timeline,i logged in to my account using another phone and it's working, please what could be the cause of this??"
3af9788b-457a-4fe0-a45d-2fda96782b87,"Worst experience with Linkedin, No support at all. My current account is restricted permanently without any prior notification and explanation."
b7bade5c-f338-4ccd-b220-58978a0b760c,"Dreadful! I have hated the UI ever since I started using this app! There's always a profile glitch in LinkedIn (they take forever to load) It's not bad connection or low end device, it's the app that sucks! I don't understand how Microsoft owns this (expected better)"
94306004-4b1e-4384-9f24-3ddc43eefe9a,"would give 0 stars if I could. terrible app, it bugs you with useless notifications at all times even if you deactivate the ones you do not care about, a lot of the applications never go through, ""easy apply"" almost never works. it bugs you constantly about getting premium. customer support is non-existent, too. you MIGHT get a reply after many days, sometimes, but they will just say they closed the case and offer no help at all."
2b1cefe6-41e4-4d43-96d0-784a533ad4fc,"I am very much frustrated from LinkedIn because my ID has been restricted and I am not able to recover it. When I made a new ID LinkedIn restricted it too. Very poor customer support, takes too much time to respond 😕.."
58a4f51f-c16a-4501-9ebe-4b85323f1f89,"When people can't get the likes they want on Facebook, they use linkedin. The job listing aren't real and the fake motivational stuff the peddle is annoying."
9174faf7-2e75-4090-b3bd-226d5a6b58f5,"Can't log in for some reason. Over the last few years, I've tried to login, then I just delete the app. Every time it says wrong user name or wrong password. So today I changed my password. Wrote it down & also asked Google to remember it. Tried to login and it wouldn't let me. I even manually typed in my password. It still wouldn't let me. So once again I deleted this stupid app off my phone. I think I'm better off."
8616bb78-d424-40dc-951a-b4ac014d2e81,Horrible experience filling out tons of applications only to be told something is wrong and nothing saved. The app is very intermittent. I will have to go back to Glassdoor and Indeed because of how much time I have wasted. Can't even save application drafts half the time.
4a24984b-ea8f-4257-ad79-d2c0991c02cb,"When I click on a post to comment or read it fully, the post disappears and the feed seems to refresh. So now I cannot find the post unless I caught the poster's name , go to their feed and comb through their activities. It's not a pleasant experience interacting with LinkedIn via this app."
e603a726-1cfe-4c17-9836-094ca48bb2d0,"Wosrt experience, i can't even add email id in my profile and without that i can't contact linkedin customer service for ky other issues. . While clicking on add email id, it just says something went wrong. It is not at all enabling the option to type my email id. It is so irritating. I want to enhance my Id and after coming this far, i can't even think of making new Id. Please just fix it."
c34ef30b-ef7d-41ab-b50b-303144081bd8,"LinkedIn restricted my account without any explanation, and I've been trying to get in touch with their support for assistance, but they haven't responded. What's even more concerning is that they're asking for my ID for verification, which feels like a potential security risk. This lack of communication and transparency is extremely frustrating and disappointing."
bf3450eb-26a6-4f0e-8112-619f2c569688,I can't even join in this app...it's just saying ...let's do quick security checkup but nothing is done...it stops there...it's really sad and frustrating
90cabffc-0491-48b2-bfcf-d8ce703b07f4,All that time I spent building a profile to not be able to update my email address even with the password. Said had to be from my original email account that I deactivated due to safety and security issues. Since when has an email address become a form of identification? I can close my account with the password but I can't update the information? Lost my business for that. Done letting Google and Apple have more control over my identity then I do. You should too.
0b89c958-81a4-4ed7-a0cd-e11d4a30ba61,Why had happened to this app after the update? I am not able to access the account. What have you done to your application? This is now a big useless app if you can't even login. 😤
4e9b7bbe-672e-4524-82e0-61d1aa1bf0c1,Forget password isn't working..... I'm unable to set a new password for my account. Worst experience in changing the password.
0bb03eb8-7b61-4766-88cd-2169ea299eb4,I am not able to login to my account after entering correct answer also it is asking me to solve puzzle again and again. LinkedIn please solve this issue it's really very irritating.
b634fdaa-280f-47d1-b744-b014dce9e449,"The password code you sent must be automatically filled while one is trying to open the app in case of ""forget password"". While one looks for the code in email and then try to enter it, the previous page of your app disappears. And thus one is unable to open the app. Can you pay attention to it? The Problem still persist. I have tried it several times even after reinstalling the app. Deleting the app for ever."
00a1f7ea-c68f-48bb-88d0-ef2384e51e3e,Don't force your bell notifications sound on us. Add a way to remove them all. How dare it keeps ringing. I have all other apps silenced.
3b2fdc3c-9753-4b45-a46a-92d306019e25,I've been trying so many times to purchase my subscription. It didn't work. It kept saying that LinkedIn is experiencing some problem. What problem? If you can't provide the Premium option anymore than you should consider of removing the tool from your platform. Don't give someone hope while we can't even use it (Premium). I'm very disappointed in you! I've been using LinkedIn for years and I never felt so bad like this!
4c1476fc-be87-4db7-a067-e45b5f3518c8,Just created an ID yesterday and this app has restricted my access to it today. Even after uploading govt issued identity it is not letting me log into my own account.
95cd33a4-2b4d-4cf7-90d3-aa427a5153bc,"Recapture problem they didn't match and this app is should be updated. Because by using experience LinkedIn isn't smooth to use. Struggling, suffering.... 👎👎👎👎"
148386da-58a5-4aaa-97d4-6bec58624519,"Very disappointed. I tried one month free trial, later I realized that it wasn't useful for me. I tried to cancel my subscription then. I didn't have funds on the card attached for few weeks after that. Once I got my salary on that card, subscription fee was directly charged from my card. I can't contact LinkedIn for a refund, as there is literally no customer support! I canceled my subscription the same day again!"
ae89f94c-c24e-49d8-a0ce-c8710d6232c1,Cannot copy text or save images/video from posts. Requires lots of permissions. Use web browser instead.
3309e7f7-55bd-42b1-a879-cc02254ab9d8,"How can I get that restrictions out of my account?! No help, no customer service number, nothing at all and I'm stuck with doing nothing."
d652940f-aadc-4db5-b3d4-fa4588a4b227,"Recently there has been too many error which has been described below by other fellow users: no internet, unknown error, unable to load and the works.... Tried the usual uninstall and reinstall, no difference. Perhaps you should consider rolling back to a previous version until all these are fixed. It has become counter productive to use the app. The problem is getting worse and now I cannot login on mobile. If you read the long list of comments, we have the same problem."
05b6d850-7f81-4bc7-b33e-2882918436c5,"App worked well until last month or so and now fails to load anything and often notifications aren't received. If i do get them, then clicking it fails to load anything. Haven't seen an update for a while so wondering if LinkedIn devs even know of a problem and what sort of tests are in place to avoid releases with major issues! Please sort out, especially as i pay for a premium account and not getting any sort of service."
afbdcd91-cb19-429b-85bb-598728d51f59,"I am disappointed with the newest version of LinkedIn. When I tried to surf like usual on LinkedIn, it didn't show anything then I tried to uninstall the app and reinstall it, yet it didn't want to log in, the sign in button didn't work and stuck there. What's wrong with the newest version? Seriously, it's not an upgrade more like a downgrade."
f83790df-a544-4756-8e49-31371dab6448,The mobile testing of the app has not been done properly..there is bug in the application as it doesn't allow user to upload any file extension except jpeg or png file. The media field allows two options either camera or from gallery . This doesn't allow user to upload resume as pdf or docx. But when we switch to desktop version it allows every extension to upload. Kindly fix the bug.
7f0a7136-cef5-42c3-bd9b-02408c6fd614,Customer support needs to be quick. I have been emailing the support because of a problem with my account but no one seems to respond.
8b4dd9e8-0868-42b2-947d-1452b51fc73a,This is the worst app that I have ever seen. It keeps repeating about the verification process. Always responding that something went wrong.
43fe4cbf-4759-40b5-9796-0c38036f58a6,"Probably the worst update I ever seen. Today when I was writing a post, I received a notice just in the middle of my screen. ( that basically blocked everyting until I was forced to update my linkedin ) The results of your update are on the level of a Commodore 64 without Simon's Basic extension !! So I installed your ""update"" Linkedin icone is gone and I need to go via Google to find you. Before your ""update"", normally when you want to modify a post you have the possibilities to EDIT COMMENTS or DELETE COMMENT Now only the DELETE COMMENT is available. Pityfull !"
d234d860-63e1-48d6-98b5-5c2491f0f03a,"Linkedin had decided that i was violating their policy (which i wasn't), asked me to verify my account by submitting an ID, which i did. I had access to my account after for few days but then got blocked again. No one notified me that it was restricted. I had to find that out on my own. Emailed support but they were, and still are unresponsive. They would give no explanation or reason as to why they restricted my access. Generally very bad experience, not a trustworthy app."
f62d20f0-78d7-42cf-b330-6b6dd3754ffe,"For a very long time now I have not been able to post on LinkedIn, after writing my content and click post it will just continue loading there without posting"
00d6f750-a62a-4c1a-85ea-8eb09008eac3,Easy apply option is not working well it shows something error or asks to add email address even though I added two emails😔😠
b0f73ac5-3456-4f62-977c-ae398a4fc069,"This has got to be the worse all I've used in my life. I put in all my details, press next to go to the next page just for it to say, something went wrong. Then it gives you the option to dismiss. All the information is correct. Waste of my time, app deleted! LinkedIn replied to this email, I tried to reply via the link they send to show them what is not working. The email like does not load."
388089f6-7873-4d88-9909-bde464ce760c,"Everytime I tried to change info on the account settings and privacy settings...it leads me to ""SIGN IN""...and when I logged in...verification code was sent from a LOCAL NUMBER...Yet even if I comply..it won't lead me to the settings where I'm supposed to change. I've done an upgrade thinking that It might be due to its version...but same scenario occured. I've deleted cached data...run my anti virus..but with no avail.. Could you please fix this issue? Please..I'm running out of patience.TY!"
d928f47c-5675-4289-ac83-1a130f31a308,"app consistantly sends me push advertisement notifications early in the morning, anywhere from 4 to 6 in the goddamn morning. I got a ""sponsored message"" at 6:20 and my phone buzzed five times. Made me completely turn off notifications, which is a shame because I enjoy some of the recommendations. not nearly as much as sleep though. I get you want people to use it, but your ads don't have to act like an alarm. no one wants that."
3dc3b7a7-6822-468b-b166-818fafc94b90,Why do you insist on shoving suggested posts in my feed. There's a clear reason why I only want to see posts from people I explicitly follow or have connected with. I don't want to see other people's posts if I do not follow them. How hard is it for the product manager at LinkedIn to comprehend this.
0a06a041-7c33-4156-9ad7-df7a7be0ffed,After every process error massage is coming out. Either you are updating profile to trying to contact them.every time error massage are generated.also unable to get excess to my account when trying to open after a long time. Verification system is so much poor.i send the documents multiple times but all are rejected. And also too many bugs to fix with
786d8be9-0c31-4cce-be22-4cfa927527ec,Very terrible i have uploaded id card yet i can't login been trying for like a month. An Email verification with phone number should be ok i dont even know why my account was blocked

b4dfbba1-b6b7-4cbc-8ef8-d597931d5fed,Fraudulent and unprofessional. I was given option of FREE TRIAL FOR 1 MONTH OF PREMIUM LINKEDIN. But I was charged heavy amount without any warning and without my permission. Don't install this fraud app
22547dea-30a3-419b-a76a-5f8d17d3e5c2,"Two things: * It auto-follows people. * It ignores notification setting changes. I keep getting alerts about posts from people I don't know, and have to manually un-follow. I'm uninstalling the app if I have to re-disable those settings again. I urge anyone else to consider this sort of behavior as subtly malicious from any app that does it, no matter who the maker is."
32506788-8015-4e4f-844d-e256bb0c0875,"The latest update for the app as well as web app is completely buggy. The login feature has completely crashed since last 2weeks & none bothered to fix it. OTP for 2-step authentication is not coming at all, even the Call for OTP ain't working. Today, experienced sign in issue. Initially I thought that I was giving wrong password but then checked it & noticed there's no error message, so password entered was correct but sign in has also crashed. How can anyone use the app without sign in?"

And now it's telling me to Add and Confirm an email address while I could see I have 2 email addresses already added and verified. Customer support keeps saying it has been resolved, but it hasn't."

So i went on the chat box and had it back. Now, the agent said i should write new messages to be able to send it out. There are more 1500 messages and she wants me to send it one by one.

401be346-40be-499b-85d4-9949bd6cb89c,Terrible. I never got signed in after downloading the app. Kept getting stuck on the captcha. Over and over and over and over. I didn't try and uninstall reinstall because honestly that's a waste of my dang time. I would just open a browser and go through that away. Tha ks for the spaghetti coded junk app.

User feedback includes loss of / inability to save data updates, spammy messages masquerading as job matches and HelpDesk replies of ""Sorry. Please send an email"". Obviously a case of watercooler brainstorming where showcasing a 'new thing' that somebody 'learned' took precedence over end-user friendliness and functionality. Pass."

Not able to upload my CV for days now and it does not even throw back an error or guidance. Furthermore no way to raise a ticket on this issue as well. So basically the app has its own set of limitations for sure and does not hold much worth.

Though you can set up a subscription in the app you cannot cancel it in app. Linkedin does not contact you when your trial period is about to end nor does it tell you the cost of subscription. (The developer response does not address the concerns of my review and seems auto generated. My opinion remains the same).

Why are you confusing people and wasting both the company's effort and the applicant's effort?? I still believe that LinkedIn is far better than indeed.

So I go to log back in and for some reason my account is ""restricted"". Ok so I get my email verification code, I enter it, and it's asking me for a picture of my photo ID? Uhhhh how about no.. so I message customer support and they are basically like ""it's completely secure, we only keep a copy of your ID for 14 days.."" ok. So what if your site gets hacked in 12 days? I'm out."
09781c19-cff2-438d-973b-cfb172b9412e,Maybe I'm visiting the website on my phone because i want to look at the website on my phone. I do not want to install a surveillance app in place of a perfectly adequate website - if it were not for the persistent automatic redirects. This app is terrible simply for the poor user experience it offers for the website.
e4bd0b9f-1694-460d-a1a3-85bb3e7b37f2,The worst platform. Useless site. Time waste. You'd never ever get any response from the recruiter if u apply for job. This is my 3 years experience and also same for my friends. Just only time waste app. My sincere advice.. Never ever trust LinkedIn regarding your job applies. This is just only show but nothing in return response. Only and only time waste. I and my friends had applied hundreds of jobs in the LinkedIn jobs but not a single response from recruiters.. Even our profiles r the best.

Don't provide your debit or credit card details with them..worst experience.. they're cheating their own customers.

35695904-bc52-494a-87c7-adb30fb269ee,Really too bad experience for verification part in case of reactibation account. If there will be a 0 or negative mark available then I will give 0. I tried security check with visual and play sound. It is passing and when i again trying to login it is taking me again on this security check page. I have tried more than 4-5 times. What is benefit of this app if user can not reactivate the account. Frustrated and ridiculous
