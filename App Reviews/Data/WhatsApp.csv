Update: the above issue has been resolved, now the new issue is that I cannot listen to voice messages through Bluetooth. I use WhatsApp at work with headphones in. Now I have to turn off Bluetooth anytime I want to listen to a voice message.",2
058711cc-edbe-4f94-b9e1-b780958f0564,"Since Nov. 23, there's the ever present small AI chat icon that's sitting at the bottom right of the screen. I do NOT want to turn it on, yet that is the only option when you tap the icon. Please provide options to decline or at the very least hiding the useless icon from the screen. (Android version 2.24.2.76) And, the app is still missing simple customization features. Please offer user selectable color alternatives to replace the dreaded green shades of the header and chat bubble colors.",2
835f5412-3b60-449b-8ce3-414246003036,"Honestly, they should give an option to deactivate the channels that you can follow . Not everyone needs to see more than what they want, I prefer to only see status updates about my contacts. I don't see why they added that feature without the on or off option. It would be great if they let one self decide to watch contact and news updates or only contact updates. Hope you see this request WhatsApp! Please!",2
9c706a65-c72c-4e4d-b539-81263fe67b4e,"I've had this app since 2012/13 and it's always been my favorite. Ever since adding all the features it's been so many different glitches. Mostly being audio issues. Example: If you receive a call on your regular line while on a WhatsApp video call, that will cause the other parties not to hear you. We usually reboot our phone, or uninstall/reinstall, but we really shouldn't have to do that! I will be glad to remove this review once this issue is fixed!",2
7220093d-353f-4d77-b944-d6f29a6ca8f8,"It's great to have a dedicated app for Wear OS. However, instead of being a proper companion app for the phone app, it seems to try to be its own instance like WhatsApp Web or Desktop, and thus, particularly for Bluetooth watches, it's unable to get notified of new messages along with the phone app and suffers from delays. It'd be great if you could implement something like Gmail or Samsung Messages, where the notification still comes from the phone with an option to open the watch app. Thanks!",2
bab5c6b7-938e-4bb2-a43d-556c9bb8957b,"I love it, EXCEPT that it frequently loses messages that are only a few days old. I've researched it and cannot determine a reason. I've reinstalled several times. This has been happening over two or more years. My phone is very reliable and never more than 2 years old. My OS version is always up to date. My storage space is always adequate. WhatsUp??",2
63f64dfd-d3d5-488f-898f-ed96bd846799,"Been using WhatsApp for a long time. I just switched from iphone to Google pixel 8 (have WhatsApp updated to the latest version on both phones). When I did the transition with the cable, three times it got to 96-97% of the chat history transition & then WhatsApp would just close & only about 1/2 of my chats made it. Now I am disheartened to see that bumps me out of my audio recordings as I'm making them after 2-3 seconds. I thought they had fixed this glitch already!! So annoying....",2
9861c093-1a8f-4210-b206-9312e632d66b,This app has gotten worse and worse with glitches and its driving me insane. Every single time I try to play a voice clip the App just closes and goes dark and then I have to reopen it multiple times and try to play it multiple times before I can finish a voice clip. It's insanely annoying and has been doing this for over a year now ... I'm always updating the app and it never helps the issue,2
74ca91cb-6f29-4c19-b862-f837365c372b,Works fine until you need to move phones. Lost all chat history despite having backup locally and in Google drive. Tech support is useless. Don't expect response in less than 5 hours and don't expect them to read what you wrote. Basically repeatedly suggested following the steps to install/setup the app that I'd already explained did not work in my request for help. After 3rd response they closed case without any attempt to verify if problem solved. It wasn't. All chats are gone. Worthless.,2
67c7a103-1350-488e-9ac9-4cc94b66bdb8,"it might just be a problem with my device, but recently i haven’t been getting notifications. i have, but they don’t vibrate, nor sound. they don’t even show up on my lock screen. i’ve resetted the notification controls and redid the entire thing. still nothing. i’m seriously at my breaking point. edit: just found out that popup notifications aren't “available for my version of android”. that's actually so stupid, giving that it's a messaging app and notifications are REQUIRED? FOR EVERY DEVICE?",2
71a99076-a214-4673-b093-b274790aa058,"I continuously don't get an audible ring when I get a call, causing me often to miss calls. ""DnD"" is not on, my ringtone is set to an audible volume... Terribly frustrating when WhatsApp is one of my main methods of communication. I don't like this ""channels"", thing they added. Seems very social networky. They should focus on core functionality... How about we get that stable?",2
af942b5b-8206-4e2e-8056-198c7fb2e54c,Currently listening to voice notes on this app is annoying. It keeps behaving like I am receiving a call. The screen goes off the moment I play a voice note and it starts playing from the ear speaker for calls instead of the external one. It's so annoying and sometimes while playing it stops and switches to the external then stops and switches to the in ear speaker. This is by far the most annoying user experience I have seen on any app for voice recordings.,2
8b6905c7-e10a-4d90-af3a-abf94fdf3b72,"Please stop adding unnecessary updates. I mean why would you remove the ability to swipe from chats to status!? Especially when we're so used to it now, it's really inconvenient. Putting the titles at the bottom wasn't bad, just please take back the swiping. And if you can, please make another page for groups only, the mixing really isn't nice when you have a lot of groups",2
46439773-e3bf-4dc9-bb29-a4ac6cde8585,"The app lags so many times and my messages don't send no matter the internet connection strength. It's like I type and the message isnt sent and I have to restart my phone to send sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes the app doesn't open at all and the screen stays black with the WhatsApp icon. Uninstalling and reinstalling doesn't do anything, force stop, clear cache is also not doing much. Regardless of the issue on my phone the app works fine on any computer.",2
beda475b-f251-4dc4-8189-a1552118ce0a,It was a wonderful app then came the channel update it's degraded and stayed only a good app before the new update (current one) it's the worse now I just hate this app the interface isn't user-friendly and not to mention you'll have to press a damn button (on screen not physical) to access status! I think the development team should bring back the more user-friendly version back. Shame on Meta,2
f0808afa-0c0b-4297-8258-4a4ce595de8d,"This new update is not good at all because it has disabled SWIPPING. Adjusting to it by having to tap each feature is stressful. I think that the updates should focus on enhancing the quality of videos and pictures posted on status. Please, it much more preferable if we could just stick to swipping. Thank you",2
6a33b807-af46-473a-9a62-6feeb3a2ecb0,"All new interface after update is very absurd,I know very well that the characteristic of the What'sApp menu display is very attractive, unique, and iconic, but in this update many functions are missing or only my cellphone is like this, for example: the edit chat feature, now it's not there on my device. I LIKE OLD VERSION OF WHAT'S APP",2
7d560d30-9f65-42c8-b84f-2e76978439aa,"after the split screen update the app is horrible. It now looks cluttered and unorganized. Contacts are constantly on show, messages made smaller to fit the split screen it's an update that was clearly not thought through especially for those with sight problems please go back to the original full screen.",2
fb256994-c9f6-461f-bf31-4646fa7ff536,"UI/UX The app has a non-intuitive and old interface. The Community tab in the top-left part of the UI is small and hard to reach. Finally, viewing who viewed a message is also non-intuitive (swiping from the right of the message would be better). FEATURES Inability to share large files of any kind (mp4 , pdf...). Inability to clear individual private and group chats. Media quality. BUGS The profile picture failed to load; Default message timer had to be set manually for all contacts;",2
7f381ff5-a614-4e26-b744-73305ff215e5,"update - left, right swipe feature is back but bottom tab view still looks pathetic. added one star for swipe feature. The new design of status bar in bottom is pathetic and extremely inconvenient to use. Kindly bring back the old style of top status bar, for same reason i had switched back to android from ios and now you made it look like ios. Kindly revert it or provide option. When it was on top i could easily swipe right to status, calls etc.. bottom one looks stupid and not useful.",2
1eab9172-43d5-4bc5-8671-611701dd6cf7,"I usually don't write reviews, but this new update annoys me. The user experience is certainly a downgrade, if I had an option to roll back to the previous version, I would. The app already had an easy ""swipe"" to navigate between Chats, Status and Calls. Why change that? Now, I have to move my finger to the bottom of my screen to tap the buttons just to navigate these tabs. It just feels annoying, especially on a phone with large screen size. Please bring the Swipe back.",2
94589efb-a5dd-4154-bfc0-b5df52609ce7,"App was good. Is good for just chatting. Sending links or videos not so good. They can't be opened. Have checked app permissions, security permissions and all are saying it should be able to open links. Still not able to. Contacted support, they keep closing the ticket claiming nothing is wrong and won't help solve the issue. The one message they did confirm was it is now run by meta and Facebook platforms on a business level.",2

Today I got a message that - This account has been restored. Our systems flagged your account accidentally. We apologize for this. Chats can be accessed after you verify your account. HOWEVER THE PROBLEM ISN'T RESOLVED AS I CAN'T OPEN WHATSAPP TO ACCESS CHATS. Also, showing is that Beta program for this apps is currently full.",2

Please fix this BIG BUG/ERROR asap",2
771c8a2b-f265-4462-adc2-6897a0fbe971,"I LOVE this.... BUT why take away our pop-ups??? This doesn't help me, let alone anyone else, by the looks of it. Please put the pop-up option back. It's easier for on the go, and for people who don't have time to unlock phone to go into the app... also, you HAVE to go online... sometimes we don't want others to know we've been online so can swipe right, or mark as read from the lock screen. You didn't even put this new feature in the ""What's new"" details...",2
8725e119-3485-4344-970d-87fed541cfa7,"I've completely edited my comment since we're swapping new problems for the old ones (thanks for addressing the last). Perhaps, it is because I'm from a region where WhatsApp is used for texting primarily and seeing life updates on the statuses of people one actually knows and have met, that the instant reactions which are similar to instagram are quite inconvenient. The long aspect ratio of statuses is also inconvenient, especially when it gets in the way of reading a long caption.",2
a5cb825c-ed88-4bb6-9320-c67c4a8e28a3,"Would be so much higher of a rating if it didn't use non-standard markdown to format its messages, with inconsistent support across platforms? I can't understand the desicion to almost use markdown, but randomly change a few things, like sure it might not need table support, but why change the syntax used just a little? I also really dislike that images MUST be downloaded. There's a preview of the image in the app, so clearly the data has already been sent in some capacity?",2
9787ee4c-beef-449f-b2b9-cadcb9e47dd5,"Hey there, I just wanted to share my experience with the S23 Ultra. While it's a powerful device with great camera capabilities, I've been really disappointed with the quality of media when I post it. Whether it's pictures or videos, the quality seems to take a nosedive, making me look bad compared to my iPhone-using friends. It's not just a slight compression issue; it's significantly reducing the picture quality. Even iPhone 8s users seem to be getting better results. Hoping for improvement.",2
05f1bbb6-ab87-4f99-a199-d964f6a0471a,"An otherwise superb app has begun crashing since the past couple of days. When I write about the problem to the developer's email id mentioned here, I get AI formulated responses that indicate the problem isn't even being underdtood correctly in the first place! I even get an error message stating that the app has a bug, which I even shared while communicating with the mentioned email id. But, to no avail and the problem persists!",2
12234362-915e-4b1c-80a6-6e4c10116610,"Honestly, most recently, whatsapp has been a haven for bugs as it seems no one over there is in charge of quality control. When I post a video status, it doesn't play from my end, and my contacts can't view it either. The button reply for statuses is quite unnecessary, replying a status is an intentional action, and the swiping up to reply gesture was just fine for that. Now, I can't even read the caption on a contact's status without accidentally sending a reply.",2
799d5004-abd4-4d3e-84c3-58ceee2d3d31,The new feature in android the navigation bar ( status chat community) has moved to the bottom I don't line this feature. 2nd you cannot take screenshot of the profile pictures of friends. It is not right if someone is showing you your picture there is no need for privacy. They already have the privacy option to whom they can show their profile picture. For these 2 reason I have reduced WhatsApp from 5 stars to 2 stars. Overall app is fine. I would encourage them to revert those features.,2
b2a07e60-f130-4df4-90aa-dbbd18b68e87,The app has outdated functionalities which do not offer an exciting experience as compared to the 'unofficial' GB apps. It doesn't offer privacy at all. For example when i want to view status without being seen by the sender. I also can't download profile pictures/status as in GB apps. I can't hide messages. With WhatsApp there's no option for colours. It is just a boring essentiality,2
29da244a-3ddc-45d4-980e-5662c0bffbf9,"A recent update of the app has caused issues with the stickers, I tried getting help on the app today 14/3, but I was sent a message that on chat you'll don't address media issues, the issue is when one scrolls down to get to a set of stickers the stickers automatically get back to the start which makes it difficult to get to a certain set of stickers & choose one, surprised this hasn't been noticed & corrected so I thought to inform.i hope this will help to solve the issue.Thanks",2
7134f4c0-861a-4c1d-b733-cc326f055ed4,"Enable the swipe feature for moving from chats to status to calls.. it was more handy than clicking on the button at the bottom of eah tab. When a channel is joined, the scrolling of status becomes inconvenient due to updates from channel at the bottom. Instead keep status updates as it was without joining any channel and keep updates for channel at bottom with LtoR scroll. Give option to see all unread msgs together instead of scrolling through the msg list",2
