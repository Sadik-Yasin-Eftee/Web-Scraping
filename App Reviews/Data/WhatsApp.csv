367017e1-f269-4413-ba82-cfe36eac167c,"The calling feature on a Note 20 Ultra really sucks. I have two phones, a note 20 and a note 8. I rarely have problems with a video call freezing up or dropping on the note 8, but it does it all the time on the note 20 to the point where it's almost impossible to make a video chat call without it freezing up or the call dropping. It's a good thing I have two phones, but I find it odd that this app works better on my old note 8 than it does on my note 20. They're both on the same network too.",1
e7b50525-598c-469d-a628-6b99d7aa1278,"I don't know what has happened, but as of recently, I cannot have a video call without it reconnecting at least 5 times and the call dropping. I'm connected to strong wifi, and nothing has changed, so I don't understand why I'm having these issues now. It's extremely frustrating and makes communicating almost impossible. It is taking all my self-discipline to not get disrespectful and unleash a slew of profanity.",1

I no longer have the ability to see deleted messages, can't view a status without been seen and several other tweaks that whats app plus had. It's like I went back in time. If your gonna take away a good platform atleast give us something to work with not just the basics. I hate this app now!!!",1

It won't let me. It just went through the setup. I tried force closing the app and what not trying to get it to start over. However every screen it gives me advances the setup process. No way to try the code again. My old phone was immediately logged out of Whats App aswell so I assume all the media data is gone now..... I am extremely angry & sad",1

However, my recent experience has left me frustrated and disappointed. I am currently unable to log in with my registered WhatsApp number, as the app prompts ""We couldn't send an SMS or CALL to your number"". I hope the developers address and resolve this matter promptly to restore the app's functionality and user experience to its former glory.",1

It's EMBARRASSING how unreliable ""backup"" is, and how utterly awful the handover is when switching sims between phones. Shameful that people continue to use this.",1
7512ff8c-2bef-4997-8220-12dacb67dd4b,App has been good so far but recent update include bugs for media/message sent or received. Voice message is really good. Video and voice calling tends to lose connection at lot. Recent update can let sender of media delete them even after viewing the message and one month has gone. So message or media ends up deleting on both ends not just on the sender end.,1
e408d6bb-6a24-43a4-a350-80b5c5766ac7,There are 2 major issues I absolutely hate about this app. 1) PLEASE introduce an option to turn off the new feature CHANNELS. I and everyone I know hates it! 2) Written text is not being saved longterm as a draft if you leave it unsend due to a phone call interruption or distraction. It is frustrating to loose all of your draft text by the next time you get back to that chat a few hours later or the next day. App saves it only for a short time. This doesn't happen with any other texting app.,1

I looked for updates; I'm using the latest version. I restarted my phone several times. Also, my phone is new, Android 13. This app started this issue last week. Until then, there were no issues.

c578ce63-6bfd-42f4-abad-eb93c0c40a49,"I usually don't write reviews, but this new update annoys me. The user experience is certainly a downgrade, if I had an option to roll back to the previous version, I would. The app already had an easy ""swipe"" to navigate between Chats, Status and Calls. Why change that? Now, I have to move my finger to the bottom of my screen to tap the buttons just to navigate these tabs. It just feels annoying, especially on a phone with large screen size. Please bring the Swipe back.",1

"" So lots of chats don't appear whether for groups or individuals... In addition, when it came to the back up, it took like 2 months to back up 28 gigabytes !!! It was unbelievable.

This has been going on for a while and I thought the newest update woud fix it, but it didn't. It just ruined the app's aesthetic by moving the bar containing chats, groups.. etc down and made it more annoying to use.",1

Big and bulky icons. Day by day UI is becoming more worst.",1
1d2e86d1-759e-4371-89d7-a08bb9bfa3a9,Really disappointed by new update with navigation bar at bottom. Problem is that I'm now used to of earlier version (coz I've been using it for years ) and this sudden new update cause more efforts and time as it is in bottom with no sliding options which drives me crazy most of the time. Support team pls look into this issue for better user experience. Thankyou,1
44db14df-9028-435a-af4d-cf92f493392e,It's very irritating when someone posts a high quality picture or video on your status and whatsapp drops it so low that you can barely recognize your post. Please kindly improve this or let us have the option to post in HD!!! And please let's go back to other interface that let's us slide through the tabs. This new bottom tab thingy isn't an improvement.,1

Getting spam calls and messages, I have never gotten those on this platform before the 'local networking statuses' were added.

Just please stop with the unnecessary changes and revert back to the WhatsApp roots before I convert my friends and family to Telegram or something.",1

For them to listen to us, we should avoid the app from getting locked, which isn't possible unless you keep on tapping the screen to avoid locking.

b2f64a06-c237-4d83-a029-37db971576d5,"Disappointed with the Latest WhatsApp Update I've been a loyal WhatsApp user for years, but the latest update has left me extremely disappointed. The new layout is cumbersome and counterintuitive. The option to switch between chats and statuses by swiping right or left has been removed, which was a feature I used daily. Now, everything is crammed into the bottom area, which feels cluttered and awkward to navigate. WhatsApp, stop trying to mimic other apps and bring the old interface back.",1

I spent more than 24 hours restoring media whatsapp from the Google Drive, and in the end, no chat history has been no media. I want to know how I am restoring my data and files it's the worst thing.

The moment I attempt to scroll down, even if I'm scrolling as slow as possible, the screen jumps back up to the top of my saved stickers. It's as if there's a glitch preventing me from scrolling any further. Also, the app is constantly crashing. I'd be typing, and mid texting, my screen would freeze, and the app would have to be closed and reopened in order to work again but it doesn't even work for long before it crashes again.",1

This feature has been helpful in saving time and avoiding confusion about the availability of person I am trying to call.
