Just did a restart and now I can't see any of my notifications within the app. I tried to report this to the help desk, after I tried all the recommended ways to fix the issue (which didn't work) and all I get is the ""something went wrong try again"". So, I get notifications but can't actually view comments, likes, etc.",1

I've tried just scrolling, I've tried pressing the ""not interested"" button (which never works), and I've even tried blocking the accounts, but nothing works. Tiktok, please for the love of God fox your algorithm to where it permenantly never shows you stuff you don't want to see, it would save me and a lot of other people from being thrown into a spiral.",1

Every time I edit a video, I can't save a draft and so I edit on the spot but the app freezes, crashes, and I'm left half an hour invested into the editing process with nothing to show for it. I use a Pixel phone but didn't start having issues until I started posting 3 times a week. It progressively got worse until now I can't do anything to edit inside the app.",1

It looks good, then when going to publish, throws text and overlays all over the place, off screen, etc. Is this a push to get me to delete the app? Cause I'm about at that point. Not the first time, but definitely getting worse.",1

I had to dispute a charge w my bank and when I got back on almost all of my videos were muted, even ones that were not copyrighted and had been previously approved and the songs are still available on the app. They definitely target accounts.",1
3abea28d-c039-4762-a26d-4168e22c3951,"This is getting less and less optimized for my Z Fold 3. About a year ago, it was absolutely fine. About six months ago, after an update, the comment section was only visible with a quarter of what it should be. Now the most recent update gives me a black screen, sometimes cuts the used space of the video in half and the other half being black, sometimes does that except cuts the actual video in half. Even more irritating is when it works for the first couple, then goes into one of those bugs.",1
8630c17a-74b1-4bd8-b283-e16071acdbac,Honestly deserves 1 star. I've been dealing with this issue over the past two years and l've reported it previously but you guys never fix this issue for me. I try looking at filters and I try to enjoy the filters that I see in my for you page but it never gives me the option to even see them. My friends and other people are able to see these filters and use them but in my case they don't show up on my end. Please fix this issue for me it's been far too long for this continue happening.,1
46843a4d-e9bb-46eb-b01b-814e7197740f,"Used to be a good app, but then the updates screwed it over. They got rid of their dark mode for Android, making it difficult for people with visual issues to see the screen from the HARSH white mode, they messed the comments up, and the pre-post to posted editing ratio is all messed up. Ex: I edit and upload a video thinking all of my text is in the frame when it isn't and half of it isn't legible from it being blurred or cut out. Used to be good, got worse.",1
2f31d92f-8ead-4909-b22c-4c5f54e81911,DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE NEWEST UPDATE! Used to love the app until The new update made the transition screen spin... genuinely considering closing my account because of it. And having photosensitivity turned on does NOT change it. They give the option to avoid videos with flashing lights but put it a potential trigger that can't be removed. I would give no stars if I could. Very disappointed,1

If I go to a creators profile to view their videos, or even my own profile, each thumbnail is blank. **After new app update, still can't see thumbnails/previews and the long press to select playback speed has been moved to the bottom when it was conveniently at the top. What is that about??!",1

I have them saved (if i click on an audio, i can save it), but when i go to my saved audios it is all blank. Please fix this. Also, sometimes filters will just stop working out of nowhere. My account got deleted because I was under the age of thirteen... TIK TOK.. I AM 18! I changed my username, and the app suddenly refuses to work and kicks me out of the app. If this keeps happening, I'm uninstalling",1
affb0a1a-5525-4068-bec2-1d7470a9da03,"Has a number of bugs that support has put in zero effort to fix. If you minimize the app to go into a different one, tiktok will reopen itself if someone messages you. Saying ""not interested"" and blocking certain audios doesn't work, and I have specific tags blocked that STILL show up in my feed. Also now it turns on my phone's volume whenever I open the app and there's no way to stop this.",1
16a1ff1b-e00c-4709-9c91-259da069a53f,Stopped letting me upload videos correctly. It would show the full video in the selection part but once I tried to edit the video it would only upload a couple seconds of each video. On the rare occasion it would let me edit the video it wouldn't upload more than the first 10 seconds even though the video should have been a minute long. Tried to get help from TikTok but they didn't reply. Uninstalling didn't help nor did restarting phone.,1

I'm either unable to scroll after 10 minutes or if I do get to scroll it's the same three videos over and over and 90% of the time it's useless ads. Tiktok is broken. 1/19/24 new glitch, if you pause a video, after a few seconds it will start playing again.",1

The last time I sent a ticket, customer support essentially said ""Okay but have you tried logging in?"" in a response that was almost certainly AI, and promptly ghosted me afterwards. Don't even bother. Genuinely.",1

I have the latest updated version, space, ect, but for whatever reason, it does not post my videos if they're over 3 minutes, and it also does not save to my drafts. So, all the effort I put into editing my videos. TikTok just throws my effort down the drain. If it does not improve these issues I will be deleting my account",1
78bfd3c6-ded9-4c6c-a1ab-32f1f7f87b7a,I miss the app tiktok used to be. Now there's ads that will pop up during a video that your watching. Three times now I've had a video basically ruined for me because an ad cuts off the end. I find it crazy that started happening as soon as people started blocking the shop hashtags. TT developers if you're listening the ads are too much it takes every drop of fun away (I'm sure you don't actually care anything to get that money right) the app is trash!,1
4d194fde-5b63-45aa-b6e2-2472f5b23c3c,8 months ago my TikTok started loosing major features... the ability to edit.. use filters... use sounds... etc. Several friends have had similar experiences. No matter how many times we have written & requested help from TikTok...none of us have heard back. We have all tried to erase & redownload many times. Some friends have left the app now & I have barely any basic features left. I suspect that TikTok is made for iPhones and anyone with a less common phone gets issue after issue.,1

When I finally get pass this pop ups, it takes me to a completely different video. If you want to make it easier for people to watch, get rid of the stupid pop ups. Make it easier for me to watch a video, at this rate, I get it to work, I kinda lose interest .I'll stick to YouTube where it's been easier, thanks!",1

f50ca6b1-6d8d-4558-915d-6aa27be977e1,"There are so many flaws to this app's system and formatting. The only thing that makes it good is the community of people creating content. To name a few issues that I notice the most: the search engine is inaccurate, I can never find videos again unless I like them, the unwatched button doesn't work, and the app reposts videos randomly on my account.",1
3456bd4e-abe8-41a0-9f99-00de65fa776f,TikTok automaticly opens videos that it thinks I might like. I hate all of them. It sucks up over 600MB of user data containing God knows what and several hundred more MB in cache. I clear storage frequently and it still uses almost 500MB program storage. Could easily be reduced to half that size or less. A glorified video player doesn't even need that much. The only explanation is that the Chinese spyware requires all the extra resources. It's most certainly not user oriented functionality.,1

You put in the password, complete the authentication, and then it just makes you put the password in again. Top of that, my videos are disappearing? I post them and they're completely gone within less than 10 seconds. They're not getting flagged for community violations to my knowledge, they're just getting pulled.

752ebf08-716f-4829-9324-5272e521cf85,"NEVER DOWNLOAD THIS! This app is so bad. The only ""good thing"" is watching videos. When I try and use an effect, it will ALWAYS say ""This effect doesn't work with your device"". Even when I have a strong internet connection, It says that. Also these bots that send you to 🧡🖤 websites. In my inbox I'm flooded with 99 notifications. When I think I finally am famous, all I see is ""Hannah😘🍑, liked your video."" My point is that you should beware of bots and bugs in the app before you download this.",1

I've updated, restarted phone, everything. Tried reaching out to support tech and that was a joke, told me to do things I told them I already done, then told me to report it on the app and never heard anything back.

Such as of course phone promos and now it's to download movie or series app. The worst part about these movie apps they are very disturbing. Having to do with SA or SEXUAL CONTACT. THAT'S ONE WAY TO KEEP ME OFF OF THIS APP. I wish there was a way to turn off commercials but unfortunately there isn't. Tiktok has been able to make me feel uncomfortable ONCE AGAIN.
