I press and hold a reel to make it bigger and get stuck. Have to restart the app. The time slider doesn't work or disappears half the time. And every time I open a suggested reel, it tells me I can scroll to see more. Like as though I don't know that by now. Also, where is the opt back in to political suggested posts? Does it even exist? Or are you lying?",2
a298ac61-d11d-4bcc-8262-317e43f96c2c,"I like instagram, but this app has a lot of issues lately. Ever since updating the app a couple of weeks ago, I can no longer add my own posts to my story. The button no longer exists. I only have the option to share. Yes, I clicked on both the plane icon and the 3 dots and it's not there anymore. My account is public. I checked on a friend's phone and she has the story button. I have cleared storage and reinstalled it, but nothing works. This is extremely frustrating to deal with.",2

Often I have to go back to conversations i had YEARS ago to fix it. Then it happens again out of nowhere Update: this is STILL an issue a year later Update 2: I just installed it in a new phone and it freezes. Can't tap on anything, so i have to close the app and reopen it for it to work. Update 3: can't share reels or pictures to anyone :'(",2
9d62fdde-fd9f-4ce5-843e-f58bd0f45e23,"it's starting to be less fun. I use the app mostly for family, friends, and looking at sports highlights, food, and comedy. The notification icon will say I have notifications, but then it's all ""suggested for you"" but most of the ""suggested"" are accounts where we dont have any friends in common. and mostly spam accounts. Also you can only pause notifications for 8 hours. After that there will be messages and what's in them going across the screen. Tried to turn it off or pause, but no.",2
46e62a2f-cfe8-4aa2-b61a-58a3ef6f0f85,"App is okay. At best. 1) Algorithms are trash. Starts on a random feed you likely haven't seen yet, just before refreshing itself to show you a whole new recycled feed. 2) Photo sharing consistently degrades quality. 3) Pausing videos is buggy. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Goes hand in hand with: 4) The NEW problem of not being able to go forward or back on a video while it's playing. If this wasn't an accidental bug, you should probably reconsider. Please fix?",2
da8ec69e-7a9c-44ee-8df0-1982392f4234,It seems there's a glitch where the bar at the bottom where I used to be able to fast forward to go to a specific spot in the reel isn't allowing me to do this anymore. Not sure if it's a glitch or if that feature was removed. But it is impacting my experience with Instagram pretty negatively because I don't want to have to watch the whole reel from the beginning if I want to see a specific part of the video.,2
df105e4f-5aa4-476f-a8d7-a9bc446b33c8,"I've used Instagram for years but it's gotten so glitchy and frustrating... half of the time when I make edits it readjusts the picture so it's half out of frame or loses other filters or adjustments I've made. Also even though I have adjusted the settings to not save photos to my camera roll, they still show up there after I post them so I suddenly have duplicates of things in my phone. So annoying.",2
ccf0336f-f9b4-41fe-8a18-e2f86ea4a3a7,"There is currently quite a huge issue with this app. When trying to format images in a story, the screen goes completely black and you have to restart the process, upon which the photos get stuck in the 'processing' stage. I have tried every method to fix this to no avail, and am not the only person currently experiencing this. In addition, text keeps turning invisible when you try to write something on your story. Hopefully there will be a fix soon!",2
ba624310-efa0-45d2-918d-70847c568efe,"Recent updates have so many bugs. 1) Instagram no longer can see any photos or videos on my SD card, only internal memory. 2) Only way I can add a story is by going to my profile and clicking the + at the top. The + on the main feed screen results in an error. 3) I no longer have the ability to schedule posts. I used to have it, now it's gone. This is HUGE for a small business who needs to regularly post content. Please fix these issues ASAP! Android user if that makes a difference.",2

I can't create reels w/o it glitching & me having to either start over, or save the draft & ex out of the app. Even posting pictures is the same way. I try to adjust the photos as I click them, so that they're just ready, & as soon as I click the check mark to continue, it resets the photos completely off what I had designated. If I try to edit in the section that's MADE 4 editing, it blacks out & crashes. Even more issues!",2

Very easy to get hacked, happens A LOT. Bad costumer service I, nor did my friends get any help. Also glitchy as hell, and constantly won't let me do the simplest of tasks.",2
420552e7-69fc-44f8-9fbf-d66191f90a04,Had to change my review since the update. It's gotten more confusing now but my only main problem is not being able to skip and fast forward parts on other people's reels. It's frustrating because I have to fully watch the reel just to rewatch it again. 😭 I wish we could find templates in an easier way. If there is I haven't found it yet.,2
caf6f8f8-0ea9-4f7c-8e9a-34a8ad5db1c5,"This app is okay. However, refusing to copy other platforms can make it better. Equally, an ever-changing algorithm, constant glitches, and a lack of originality make this platform extremely difficult to enjoy and grow. Even worse, at the time of this review, everything is Reels, Reels, Reels. This excludes individuals wanting to share images, etc. Long story short, it sucks. 😶",2
c885b731-ff9e-4561-b9ef-658b05ea8497,"There is some glitch right now where it doesn't show captions. If you click into the comments and then back out, the it will finally show up but it's super annoying and inconvenient. Also the auto refresh is getting out of control; you can barely finish looking at something before it's gone. If I want to refresh my feed, guess what, I will refresh it. If I am not initiating it then I don't want it!",2

Although the constant random glitches and the app closing randomly doesn't make it enjoyable, it is rather irritating. Looking through the accounts I follow, it constantly resets itself back to the top of the list if I even touch the screen. And many more ""glitches"" along with that... Overall, FIX your app, please.",2

I was suddenly kicked out of my account while using the app and did not receive any notifications as to why, so that was odd. I spent a few hours trying to log back in, only to find that I am unable to update any of my old information connected to the 2-Step Authentication Process. Every time I tried to update it, the system stated that no changes could be made. More frustrating there's no Tech Support to speak to regarding the matter.",2

The only way I can post from that album, is through the share option directly from the photo when I open it from the gallery first. This is fine for when I'm just wanting to post a single photo, but I can not share multiple photos to one post this way, so I'm stuck sharing camera pics one at time, one pic per post.

Had to check via browser on my laptop to even see them! I have lost business when I could have used it because of it. On top of that I haven't been able to use the draft feature in years. If I save something to draft, it will tell me only that it cannot be posted. I just have to post regularly. So that feature is absolutely useless to me. I have reported these issues repeatedly",2

Note Android user so don't know if that has anything to do with it.",2

You will be browsing and all of a sudden the text will turn black and you won't be able to see it on a black background. Or once in a while the background and text turns white. Usually you can close Instagram and reopen and UT resolves. But it's going on a few years with the same issue.,2

The editor for reels always crashes and also saves tons of edited videos on my phone even after posted or deleted, so my Instagram winds up with a storage of up to 10gb.

The drafts feature doesn't work, it either glitches when you go to save it as a draft or errors out when you post the draft.

It malfunctions so often that it makes me lag posting content because I get so frustrated with it and quit. I hate that this is the main platform for marketing because I hate how poor the UI is, and I hate every time I have to post. Saved drafts don't load, reel creation isn't detailed enough, not enough analytics, while creating a post if you so much as look at another app it will reset or crash.",2

Instead, it just gives me a list of suggested accounts to follow that I couldn't care less about. Give me notifications in the notification tab. How hard is that? I also hate the ""auto-refresh"" thing it does occasionally. In the middle of reading comments, it'll refresh and the post is gone forever if I didn't give it a like.",2

Moving the home bar to the left side of the screen for tanlets was a very bad idea..it shrinks the size of the picture or video we're looking at there's no improvement at all with this change.

I dont know why ig offers you to view least interacted with, but not unfollow them. Going to every page to press unfollow is really irritatingly tedious and time counsuming, especially when your following count is in the thousands.",2

I was observing in my previous device that when I used to exit the app by pressing back key, I can still hear the audio from the last video which I was watching. I thought it was issue with my old device but I can observe the same glitch in my new device. The audio will only go away when I clear the app from the recent button on the bottom.",2

I've reported it multiple times and have only gotten two notification thus far. Once when my report apperantly did not go though and another time when it did go though... it just said ""thank you for your Bug report"". Since then it's been days and nothing has happened. All the other times I've made reports, I didn't get any notification, and under reports I've made, no report are shown. Such a shame.",2

5e8e9015-fcf0-4c93-a331-23f011ebbba2,Stop updating the app so tag notifications goes to messages instead of my regular notifications. It's incredibly annoying getting a message every time someone tags me in something. This was an update a while ago that was finally changed back to comments but now it's back to showing up in my messages and it's getting on my nerves. I doubt I'm the only one that feels that way.,2

Everything else about the app is perfect apart from the new update, and just for that I will give it 2 stars but am tempted to give it 1. Thank you for hearing my criticism and keep well :) (although some text features such as the flame have the possibility to keep the app interesting if future features similar are executed correctly)",2

Also chats have been very glitchy for YEARS and often require closing and reopening the app to see messages. I also keep getting the same accounts suggestions while viewing stories despite clicking see fewer. And I keep getting notified to join broadcasting channels when I turned them off on all my accounts",2
