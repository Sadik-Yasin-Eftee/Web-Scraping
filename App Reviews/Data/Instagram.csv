492c723b-f663-444b-9a2e-40759a083c7a,So many issues. I think every update just messes something else up. I use IG mostly for video chats and all of a sudden I can't connect to Bluetooth and I no longer have a full screen of the person I'm talking to nor do they get a full screen of me it's just two half photos on top of each other. Trash. The sound is not the best if you are in a room with anyone else since staying connected to Bluetooth is almost impossible. I would love to go back to normal video calls. Now instagram is down! 🤦,1

But recently this app has taken a downhill turn. I can't look up or use any audios, all I get are suggested music audios that quite frankly, suck. I also have to constantly rewrite a reel text 5 times because this app keeps deleting my text whenever I make a post, reel or photo. And it's getting annoying. Do better.",1
b77bb58d-93d1-4fb2-8f2e-7d406fd847e1,"This app has become so poor I'm so close to leaving it completely. Tagging people resets the post. Adding photos to a draft resets the post. Selecting multiple photos for a post doesn't work half the time. Basic functions have become broken to the point that I don't have time to deal with the multiple attempts and this is coming from a full time creator. Going to just focus on my YouTube content now, I'll post here when I have time to waste and a high bandwidth for frustration.",1

Key aspects that should work do not and it makes it hard to be able to use the app at all. Photo cropping does not work and resets any edits you've made constantly. The pin to profile/unpin doesn't function properly. If you open a link in someone's bio in dark mode, it immediately bugs out the whole UI when you return from the link... the list goes on.",1

The app continues to revert back to the old version and glitch out. Stories are affected, missing filters and features like my avatar. My chat themes are a mess.. From randomly not showing at all to missing graphics, there's several issues. After having and using the app for several years, why suddenly are there issues that aren't getting fixed??",1

I have full bars of service and zero problems with any other apps/ internet. Recent update wiped out my actual ""newsfeed"" No I don't want to only see 3 suggested reels of people who I don't know. What is this? Slowly getting rid of yet another of the few parts of Instagram I actually liked. This app used to be about sharing photos with friends.",1
94824bfc-cf12-4328-87b4-d01c10c1c5e5,"Stories freeze and wont play properly cant use saved audio on a story, only on reels because IG is trying to shove that feature down everyone's throat just like stupid ""threads"" and now, when a video or reel is playing and you try to fast forward or rewind, it freezes completely. Not to mention the fact that the functional layout of posting a reel, story, or post are all different = user unfriendly! It only lets you use pics for stories from your camera roll, and not other folders. What a joke!!",1
9aadc0e4-dc2d-4311-bc6f-a469004dcfce,"My feed is nothing but ""suggested for you"", even though I said to disable it in the setting. It's very annoying. I want to see what my friends are up to, not pictures of cats from accounts I don't know and nothing else. When I X a suggested post and open the content settings, it says suggested posts have been snoozed every time. This is clearly not true, given that I got to that settings page from dismissing a suggested post. Nothing but a headache",1
312b8979-3f05-4344-a475-ca6d9f749ef1,"IG has possibly the worst interface I've ever experienced. There is a progress meter at the bottom, but if you try to use it, the video pauses permanentlt. Mute?

It's been a problem for years. I've also uploaded a reel only to have its audio constantly replaying in the background even after I've clicked away from the upload, it stops once I fully exit and close the application.",1

Then you spend some time to come up with the perfect title, youre done!

I cannot turn the volume of the audio track down at all, so it is playing at full volume alongside my original audio. This is extremely frustrating because I want soft background music playing while I talk in the video, but that isn't possible anymore due to this new bug.",1
fc1fe6f7-b6dc-43fa-a41e-1b6340c1a7c5,"I've been using IG for years but the functionality has been gradually going downhill, especially compared to other platforms. Constant glitches and features disappear and reappear from one minute to the next. Not user-friendly at all, especially when creating reels. For example, SOMETIMES (not always) there's an option to crop a cover image for the square grid view but even after cropping it reverts back after posting. Also adding sounds and multiple texts to reels is glitchy and frustrating.",1

The app won't read my SD card to post photos when it used to work just fine. It auto scrolls to the next reel, refreshes without warning. Now, it won't let me see older posts of people I follow when I click on that option. It's responsive only 2/3 of the time. I don't know what's happening and it needs to be fixed.",1

Many different times I went through and selected not to see certain posts for a variety of reasons. I come back to the app later in the day only to have the exact same for you page as what was cleared out earlier in the day. Posts displayed in the same order and everything. Over, and over and over again. Meta is peddling garbage.",1

Tried to make a second account to share art and potentially start a small biz (as many people do) and was immediately disabled for no reason. When appealing, apparently taking a selfie of my real human face and confirming a code via phone number wasn't enough because I can't appeal again.

Here's a completely different one. Good luck finding the other again."" -And now trying to force Threads on us by putting it where the share to story button used to be. -And putting ads over regular reels in addition to all the regular ads every other post.

15e8e1c2-19cf-4949-a21a-aa2805e7bebd,It's gotten worse over the years. It doesn't show you the most recent post in order. It will show you suggested post that no one wants to see. The algorithm is so messed up. It only shows you post on who you follow or interact with. I prefer to see people's post in time most recent times. Not post from 7 days ago then 22 hours ago. I follow 300 influencers but only show me the top 50 . It's annoying. I would delete this app permanently but I have all my memories stored on this application.,1

There needs to be a backup or just save it if it doesn't upload the first time and/or have an option to physically try again.

There's so many ads also. Almost every other video is an ad. I keep seeing ads for a mr. breast game that is not owned by him like it says. How is this legal? Their using his name because they know how popular he is! Y'all finally fixed it to see the comments on a reel while in Facebook.

c3d1ed6d-d1c3-4f77-9efa-76df00002784,"Nothing works consistently, this app is a mess and forces me to use square aspect ratios if I don't want to post one picture at a time. The desktop version is worse, after editing and adjusting pictures, almost every time it says it can't post, and there's no ""save as draft"" on desktop so however much time I spent finding the pictures and adjusting them is just wasted.

As a musician who just records videos on my phone, wishing to record multiple takes and post the best one later, Instagram is becoming increasingly useless to me. Edit: I tried the in-app camera to record a song and for some reason you have to hold down the record button, so that obviously doesn't work. This app is living in the stone age.",1
