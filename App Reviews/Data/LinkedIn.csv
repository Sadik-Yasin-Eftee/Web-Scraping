bf50feff-cb60-4ba2-8539-a301bdccbfb6,Not the most user friendly when it comes to filtering. Why the hell and I getting jobs from three or four states away?? Then I try to use the filter and it does not let me put my location!! It just has preset cities around the US. So when I select one that somewhat close by its only showing that location! It can't be that those are the closest cities hiring!!,2

You can't save job sometimes because it will just fail. You can't save job applications in the middle of them because it will say that something is wrong.

The notifications are kind of annoying but I'm sure those can be turned on.",2

Uploading media is problematic. Why not use the full Android media picker? I can use Google Photos to find the photo I am looking for in most other apps. Halfway through reading an article you clicked on? Roll the dice when you reopen the app, it may still be there or maybe the app is going to take you to the feed and refresh.",2

I am trying to find a particular job in a industry, but I hate it when it only shows on my experience. Even if I filter the search, it shows jobs that I am way underqualified for and it is discouraging to see my experience is not enough for internships or entry-level jobs.",2

9d9c8d71-2e91-45fe-b288-8ac5b00cb267,"This app seems to be more or less a wrapper for the mobile LinkedIn website, and it does that poorly. The layout overlaps the screen edges without the ability to resize, meaning lots of horizontal scrolling back and forth to read stuff, as well as the inability to access all icons in the top tool bar of the site without rotating the phone to landscape view. It's clean looking and simple, but these layout issues drastically reduce usability. Unusable for me, even on a large screen phone (Note 8).",2

Then installed the app. It immediately: (1) took me thru a series of network-building screens that I've seen before and have no interest in, as though I were a new user with no network; and (2) added the 50 or so people I had just dismissed back into the potential-contact list.

Now it's filled with a bunch of people that are only concerned with tricking others into liking their post.

Until recently we have grown more dissatisfied with the way that you project the magazine the inclusions and articles that you include.

bd837178-6a79-43ac-b903-3ad413001e1d,Finally caved to installing the app due to the constant nagging that had to be dismissed in the web browser. First thing I tried was to find the settings to turn off push notifications. That process was a few minutes long fight with poor UI and UX design to find where those were. The number of back button presses to get out of those settings was ridiculous. Main functionality is just ok but almost all of it is pretty much just the web version with a few mobile navigation touches. No real UX distinction in my opinion to annoy and force people to use the app over the web version.,2
