This app is really pretty annoying. it said I didn't allow any permissions but it gave absolutely no further instruction. So for a $1.99 I figured what do I have to lose. Well I have a lot of time to lose because I spent the money I now have the premium app I set the timer and I got the same message. It says you have not set permissions but it gives no instruction as to how to set permissions and no button that I click works. If it wasn't too much aggravation I'd be asking for a refund.,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I missed my work today because of your stupid ""weak alarm"" method. This means I've lost some money. Notification reliability should be of paramount importance. If something doesn't work 100%, remove it. Very disappointed. VERY! Edit: I didn't get any warning, nothing. If the other option is the recommended one (which I hate that it adds an alarm icon in the status bar. other apps work without doing this), it doesn't mean the other one IS NOT WORKING. Bad.

Straight forward. I like the widgets on this and makes it easy to check in on what you need to do for the day. The scheduling is also very helpful because you can have tasks that are intermittent or habits that are intermittent on a regular schedule. It's also nice to be able to have a goal as a number or just a yes or no did you do it or not. And the statistics are nice because you can look back and see how consistent you've been with something and that will remind you to buckle down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Best planner I've ever used for organizing tasks and events. Many thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Amazing, creative and motivating. Kudos Designers love the Gameboy pixellated feel really made me nostalgic. Amazing app",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Uhm there's a little bug that I encountered, I cannot disable the skill 
decay :< pls fix I'll give 5 stars",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Great for progress. Their motivation quotes stopped working. Plus it doesn't remember which habit you were last viewing... so a pain in the ass ""weekly"" intrusive display. I specifically looked for this app. Because it's simple and easy on the eyes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Love it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The day ended and i didnt end my task and it didnt shift or alarm about undone tasks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like its simplicity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This might be a good app. I didn't get to use it because the only way to use is it is to open it with a calendar app. I uninstalled the app because of that reason.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's nice, simple, and helps me to make lists that I can check off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Aplicaci√≥n f√°cil de usar y muy pr√°ctica para el manejo de tareas, que ofrece herramientas √∫tiles para crear rutinas y administrar mejor el tiempo. Sus opciones para planear, recordar y planear tareas ayudan a que estas no se dejen de ejecutar por descuido. Para mejorar, tiene la forma en la que se visualiza el formato enriquecido.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Me esta gustando el sistema que usa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So, SO, close to perfect - just not quite. It needs three things to get five stars from me. 1) Tasks should be sortable by multiple criteria, so that I can order them by date and then by priority, for instance. 2) Tasks should be nestable, with sub-sub-sub-sub-etc. tasks. 3) It should not *need* access to Google Calendar, if there is a local calendar - it should be optional, not mandatory. The rest of you, stop whining about the free version - if you want to complain, buy it first.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Used it for 4 years, April they updated it and it's now a productivity killing app rather than a productivity booster app. Why? If you wanna rename your todo list you should be able to just click on the todoist and rename it right? WRONG, it opens a NEW WINDOW with sub taks!! I now have to click 2 times to rename the todo bullet. 2 times instead of 1.. Productivity or stupidity? I'm changing todo apps until they poll their users and understand that this is absolutely horrible.. Bye for now!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"help me to organize my schedule in one stop need (calendar, tast, notes, etc) thanks Planner Pro!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why there is different icon showing of app in play store and different on my phone pls make it same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great üëå,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Cancel means stop the action...not throw away all the notes I just made...sorry but this was suppse to save time not waste ideas and planning...poor comms from app on a normalized UI function. First go and really turned me off, could be lots more awesome, but things like this and not being able to recover the info quickly then...not acceptable when doing business tasks nowadays.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It seems like a good app with good features but it's not intuitive at all. I spent fifteen minutes trying to find a way to skip a repeating task this week and I could mark it done. I try deleting to see if it would delete just that occurrences but it deleted the whole thing. The icons are also not intuitive at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nice app. I just got the pro version because it ultimately replace my daily planner book.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm changing my rating from 5 to 2. I've used this app for many years and I love it. It's a great app! But they have recently added add on videos (skippable but still 5 seconds long.. ) after you've created or closed an event in your calendar app. It's really annoying and disgusting because you don't have time watching adds when you want to add a couple of events everyday in you schedule... You've went to far Business Calendar 2...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No, I don't want to try SleepTown. Yes, I'm sure I don't want to try SleepTown town. Yes, I'm absolutely sure I don't want to try SleepTown. Please stop asking that often. Thanks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Does job,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Interesting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Widget is buggy - a task marked as completed in the app is displayed as overdue, and trying to tick it off in the widget takes me into edit mode. The proper app, when reopened, shows a blank inbox and revisiting the screen is required to populate it again. Poor punctuation (eg. ""28 Sep , 2017‚Äù - why the space before the comma) is not that big a deal, but also adds to the app not feeling very ""pro"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'll learn more.,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No notification is showing nor any alarm. I would have given a five, but what's the benefit if the app is not working its main functionality? I don't get any notification when the app is not running in recent apps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is a great productivity tool, keeps you on track with everything you set out to do",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great app,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
